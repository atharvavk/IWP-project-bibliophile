FOR NICK 
Finally . . . Always 


IF I STAY 


7:09 A.M. 

Everyone thinks it was because of the snow. And in 
a way, I suppose that’s true. 

I wake up this morning to a thin blanket of white 
covering our front lawn. It isn’t even an inch, but in 
this part of Oregon a slight dusting brings 
everything to a standstill as the one snowplow in the 
county gets busy clearing the roads. It is wet water 
that drops from the sky— and drops and drops and 
drops— not the frozen kind. 

It is enough snow to cancel school. My little 
brother, Teddy, lets out a war whoop when Mom’s 
AM radio announces the closures. “Snow day!” he 
bellows. “Dad, let’s go make a snowman.” 

My dad smiles and taps on his pipe. He started 
smoking one recently as part of this whole 1950s, 
Father Knows Best retro kick he is on. He also 
wears bow ties. I am never quite clear on whether 
all this is sartorial or sardonic— Dad’s way of an- 
nouncing that he used to be a punker but is now a 



8/256 


middle-school English teacher, or if becoming a 
teacher has actually turned my dad into this genu- 
ine throwback. But I like the smell of the pipe to- 
bacco. It is sweet and smoky, and reminds me of 
winters and woodstoves. 

“You can make a valiant try,” Dad tells Teddy. 
“But it’s hardly sticking to the roads. Maybe you 
should consider a snow amoeba.” 

I can tell Dad is happy. Barely an inch of snow 
means that all the schools in the county are closed, 
including my high school and the middle school 
where Dad works, so it’s an unexpected day off for 
him, too. My mother, who works for a travel agent 
in town, clicks off the radio and pours herself a 
second cup of coffee. “Well, if you lot are playing 
hooky today, no way I’m going to work. It’s simply 
not right.” She picks up the telephone to call in. 
When she’s done, she looks at us. “Should I make 
breakfast?” 

Dad and I guffaw at the same time. Mom makes 
cereal and toast. Dad’s the cook in the family. 

Pretending not to hear us, she reaches into the 
cabinet for a box of Bisquick. “Please. How hard can 
it be? Who wants pancakes?” 




9/256 


“I do! I do!” Teddy yells. “Can we have chocolate 
chips in them?” 

“I don’t see why not,” Mom replies. 

“Woo hoo!” Teddy yelps, waving his arms in the 
air. 

“You have far too much energy for this early in 
the morning,” I tease. I turn to Mom. “Maybe you 
shouldn’t let Teddy drink so much coffee.” 

“I’ve switched him to decaf,” Mom volleys back. 
“He’s just naturally exuberant.” 

“As long as you’re not switching me to decaf,” I 
say. 

“That would be child abuse,” Dad says. 

Mom hands me a steaming mug and the 
newspaper. 

“There’s a nice picture of your young man in 
there,” she says. 

“Really? A picture?” 

“Yep. It’s about the most we’ve seen of him since 
summer,” Mom says, giving me a sidelong glance 
with her eyebrow arched, her version of a soul- 
searching stare. 




10/256 


“I know,” I say, and then without meaning to, I 
sigh. Adam’s band, Shooting Star, is on an upward 
spiral, which, is a great thing— mostly. 

“Ah, fame, wasted on the youth,” Dad says, but 
he’s smiling. I know he’s excited for Adam. Proud 
even. 

I leaf through the newspaper to the calendar sec- 
tion. There’s a small blurb about Shooting Star, with 
an even smaller picture of the four of them, next to 
a big article about Bikini and a huge picture of the 
band’s lead singer: punk-rock diva Brooke Vega. 
The bit about them basically says that local band 
Shooting Star is opening for Bikini on the Portland 
leg of Bikini’s national tour. It doesn’t mention the 
even-bigger-to-me news that last night Shooting 
Star headlined at a club in Seattle and, according to 
the text Adam sent me at midnight, sold out the 
place. 

“Are you going tonight?” Dad asks. 

“I was planning to. It depends if they shut down 
the whole state on account of the snow.” 

“It is approaching a blizzard,” Dad says, pointing 
to a single snowflake floating its way to the earth. 




11/256 


“I’m also supposed to rehearse with some pianist 
from the college that Professor Christie dug up.” 
Professor Christie, a retired music teacher at the 
university who I’ve been working with for the last 
few years, is always looking for victims for me to 
play with. “Keep you sharp so you can show all 
those Juilliard snobs how it’s really done,” she says. 

I haven’t gotten into Juilliard yet, but my audition 
went really well. The Bach suite and the Shos- 
takovich had both flown out of me like never before, 
like my fingers were just an extension of the strings 
and bow. When I’d finished playing, panting, my 
legs shaking from pressing together so hard, one 
judge had clapped a little, which I guess doesn’t 
happen very often. As I’d shuffled out, that same 
judge had told me that it had been a long time since 
the school had “seen an Oregon country girl.” Pro- 
fessor Christie had taken that to mean a guaranteed 
acceptance. I wasn’t so sure that was true. And I 
wasn’t 100 percent sure that I wanted it to be true. 
Just like with Shooting Star’s meteoric rise, my ad- 
mission to Juilliard— if it happens— will create cer- 
tain complications, or, more accurately, would com- 
pound the complications that have already cropped 
up in the last few months.

“I need more coffee. Anyone else?” Mom asks, 
hovering over me with the ancient percolator. 

I sniff the coffee, the rich, black, oily French roast 
we all prefer. The smell alone perks me up. “I’m 
pondering going back to bed,” I say. “My cello’s at 
school, so I can’t even practice.” 

“Not practice? For twenty-four hours? Be still, my 
broken heart,” Mom says. Though she has acquired 
a taste for classical music over the years— “it’s like 
learning to appreciate a stinky cheese”— she’s been a 
not-always-delighted captive audience for many of 
my marathon rehearsals. 

I hear a crash and a boom coming from upstairs. 
Teddy is pounding on his drum kit. It used to be- 
long to Dad. Back when he’d played drums in a big- 
in-our-town, u n k n own - a n ywh e r e - e 1 s e band, back 
when he’d worked at a record store. 

Dad grins at Teddy’s noise, and seeing that, I feel 
a familiar pang. I know it’s silly but I have always 
wondered if Dad is disappointed that I didn’t be- 
come a rock chick. I’d meant to. Then, in third 
grade, I’d wandered over to the cello in music 
class— it looked almost human to me. It looked like 
if you played it, it would tell you secrets, so I started 




13/256 


playing. It’s been almost ten years now and I 
haven’t stopped. 

“So much for going back to sleep,” Mom yells over 
Teddy’s noise. 

“What do you know, the snow’s already melting.” 
Dad says, puffing on his pipe. I go to the back door 
and peek outside. A patch of sunlight has broken 
through the clouds, and I can hear the hiss of the ice 
melting. I close the door and go back to the table. 

“I think the county overreacted,” I say. 

“Maybe. But they can’t un-cancel school. Horse is 
already out of the barn, and I already called in for 
the day off,” Mom says. 

“Indeed. But we might take advantage of this un- 
expected boon and go somewhere,” Dad says. “Take 
a drive. Visit Henry and Willow.” Henry and Willow 
are some of Mom and Dad’s old music friends 
who’d also had a kid and decided to start behaving 
like grown-ups. They live in a big old farmhouse. 
Henry does Web stuff from the barn they converted 
into a home office and Willow works at a nearby 
hospital. They have a baby girl. That’s the real reas- 
on Mom and Dad want to go out there. Teddy hav- 
ing just turned eight and me being seventeen means 




14/256 


that we are long past giving off that sour-milk smell 
that makes adults melt. 

“We can stop at BookBarn on the way back,” 
Mom says, as if to entice me. BookBarn is a giant, 
dusty old used-book store. In the back they keep a 
stash of twenty-five-cent classical records that 
nobody ever seems to buy except me. I keep a pile of 
them hidden under my bed. A collection of classical 
records is not the kind of thing you advertise. 

I’ve shown them to Adam, but that was only after 
we’d already been together for five months. I’d ex- 
pected him to laugh. He’s such the cool guy with his 
pegged jeans and black low-tops, his effortlessly 
beat-up punk-rock tees and his subtle tattoos. He is 
so not the kind of guy to end up with someone like 
me. Which was why when I’d first spotted him 
watching me at the music studios at school two 
years ago, I’d been convinced he was making fun of 
me and I’d hidden from him. Anyhow, he hadn’t 
laughed. It turned out he had a dusty collection of 
punk-rock records under his bed. 

“We can also stop by Gran and Gramps for an 
early dinner,” Dad says, already reaching for the 
phone. “We’ll have you back in plenty of time to get 
to Portland,” he adds as he dials. 




15/256 


“I’m in,” I say. It isn’t the lure of BookBarn, or the 
fact that Adam is on tour, or that my best friend, 
Kim, is busy doing yearbook stuff. It isn’t even that 
my cello is at school or that I could stay home and 
watch TV or sleep. I’d actually rather go off with my 
family. This is another thing you don’t advertise 
about yourself, but Adam gets that, too. 

“Teddy,” Dad calls. “Get dressed. We’re going on 
an adventure.” 

Teddy finishes off his drum solo with a crash of 
cymbals. A moment later he’s bounding into the kit- 
chen fully dressed, as if he’d pulled on his clothes 
while careening down the steep wooden staircase of 
our drafty Victorian house. “School’s out for sum- 
mer . . .” he sings. 

“Alice Cooper?” Dad asks. “Have we no stand- 
ards? At least sing the Ramones.” 

“School’s out forever,” Teddy sings over Dad’s 
protests. 

“Ever the optimist,” I say. 

Mom laughs. She puts a plate of slightly charred 
pancakes down on the kitchen table. “Eat up, 
family.” 




8:17 A.M. 


16/256 


We pile into the car, a rusting Buick that was 
already old when Gran gave it to us after Teddy was 
born. Mom and Dad offer to let me drive, but I say 
no. Dad slips behind the wheel. He likes to drive 
now. He’d stubbornly refused to get a license for 
years, insisting on riding his bike everywhere. Back 
when he played music, his ban on driving meant 
that his bandmates were the ones stuck behind the 
wheel on tours. They used to roll their eyes at him. 
Mom had done more than that. She’d pestered, ca- 
joled, and sometimes yelled at Dad to get a license, 
but he’d insisted that he preferred pedal power. 
“Well, then you better get to work on building a bike 
that can hold a family of three and keep us dry when 
it rains,” she’d demanded. To which Dad always had 
laughed and said that he’d get on that. 

But when Mom had gotten pregnant with Teddy, 
she’d put her foot down. Enough, she said. Dad 
seemed to understand that something had changed. 
He’d stopped arguing and had gotten a driver’s li- 
cense. He’d also gone back to school to get his 
teaching certificate. I guess it was okay to be in 




17/256 


arrested development with one kid. But with two, 
time to grow up. Time to start wearing a bow tie. 

He has one on this morning, along with a flecked 
sport coat and vintage wingtips. “Dressed for the 
snow, I see,” I say. 

“I’m like the post office,” Dad replies, scraping the 
snow off the car with one of Teddy’s plastic dino- 
saurs that are scattered on the lawn. “Neither sleet 
nor rain nor a half inch of snow will compel me to 
dress like a lumberjack.” 

“Hey, my relatives were lumberjacks,” Mom 
warns. “No making fun of the white-trash 
woodsmen.” 

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Dad replies. “Just making 
stylistic contrasts.” 

Dad has to turn the ignition over a few times be- 
fore the car chokes to life. As usual, there is a battle 
for stereo dominance. Mom wants NPR. Dad wants 
Frank Sinatra. Teddy wants SpongeBob 
SquarePants. I want the classical-music station, but 
recognizing that I’m the only classical fan in the 
family, I am willing to compromise with Shooting 
Star. 




18/256 


Dad brokers the deal. “Seeing as we’re missing 
school today, we ought to listen to the news for a 
while so we don’t become ignoramuses—” 

“I believe that’s ignoramusi,” Mom says. 

Dad rolls his eyes and clasps his hand over Mom’s 
and clears his throat in that schoolteachery way of 
his. “As I was saying, NPR first, and then when the 
news is over, the classical station. Teddy, we will not 
torture you with that. You can use the Discman,” 
Dad says, starting to disconnect the portable player 
he’s rigged to the car radio. “But you are not allowed 
to play Alice Cooper in my car. I forbid it.” Dad 
reaches into the glove box to examine what’s inside. 
“How about Jonathan Richman?” 

“I want SpongeBob. It’s in the machine,” Teddy 
shouts, bouncing up and down and pointing to the 
Discman. The chocolate-chip pancakes dowsed in 
syrup have clearly only enhanced his hyper 
excitement. 

“Son, you break my heart,” Dad jokes. Both Teddy 
and I were raised on the goofy tunes of Jonathan 
Richman, who is Mom and Dad’s musical patron 
saint. 




19/256 


Once the musical selections have been made, we 
are off. The road has some patches of snow, but 
mostly it’s just wet. But this is Oregon. The roads 
are always wet. Mom used to joke that it was when 
the road was dry that people ran into trouble. “They 
get cocky, throw caution to the wind, drive like as- 
sholes. The cops have a field day doling out speed- 
ing tickets.” 

I lean my head against the car window, watching 
the scenery zip by, a tableau of dark green fir trees 
dotted with snow, wispy strands of white fog, and 
heavy gray storm clouds up above. It’s so warm in 
the car that the windows keep fogging up, and I 
draw little squiggles in the condensation. 

When the news is over, we turn to the classical 
station. I hear the first few bars of Beethoven’s Cello 
Sonata no. 3, which was the very piece I was sup- 
posed to be working on this afternoon. It feels like 
some kind of cosmic coincidence. I concentrate on 
the notes, imagining myself playing, feeling grateful 
for this chance to practice, happy to be in a warm 
car with my sonata and my family. I close my eyes. 


You wouldn’t expect the radio to work afterward. 
But it does. 




20/256 


The car is eviscerated. The impact of a four-ton 
pickup truck going sixty miles an hour plowing 
straight into the passenger side had the force of an 
atom bomb. It tore off the doors, sent the front-side 
passenger seat through the driver’s-side window. It 
flipped the chassis, bouncing it across the road and 
ripped the engine apart as if it were no stronger 
than a spiderweb. It tossed wheels and hubcaps 
deep into the forest. It ignited bits of the gas tank, 
so that now tiny flames lap at the wet road. 

And there was so much noise. A symphony of 
grinding, a chorus of popping, an aria of exploding, 
and finally, the sad clapping of hard metal cutting 
into soft trees. Then it went quiet, except for this: 
Beethoven’s Cello Sonata no. 3, still playing. The car 
radio somehow still is attached to a battery and so 
Beethoven is broadcasting into the once-again tran- 
quil February morning. 

At first I figure everything is fine. For one, I can 
still hear the Beethoven. Then there’s the fact that I 
am standing here in a ditch on the side of the road. 
When I look down, the jean skirt, cardigan sweater, 
and the black boots I put on this morning all look 
the same as they did when we left the house. 




21/256 


I climb up the embankment to get a better look at 
the car. It isn’t even a car anymore. It’s a metal skel- 
eton, without seats, without passengers. Which 
means the rest of my family must have been thrown 
from the car like me. I brush off my hands onto my 
skirt and walk into the road to find them. 

I see Dad first. Even from several feet away, I can 
make out the protrusion of the pipe in his jacket 
pocket. “Dad,” I call, but as I walk toward him, the 
pavement grows slick and there are gray chunks of 
what looks like cauliflower. I know what I’m seeing 
right away but it somehow does not immediately 
connect back to my father. What springs into my 
mind are those news reports about tornadoes or 
fires, how they’ll ravage one house but leave the one 
next door intact. Pieces of my father’s brain are on 
the asphalt. But his pipe is in his left breast pocket. 

I find Mom next. There’s almost no blood on her, 
but her lips are already blue and the whites of her 
eyes are completely red, like a ghoul from a low- 
budget monster movie. She seems totally unreal. 
And it is the sight of her looking like some prepos- 
terous zombie that sends a hummingbird of panic 
ricocheting through me. 




22/256 


I need to find Teddy! Where is he? I spin around, 
suddenly frantic, like the time I lost him for ten 
minutes at the grocery store. I’d been convinced 
he’d been kidnapped. Of course, it had turned out 
that he’d wandered over to inspect the candy aisle. 
When I found him, I hadn’t been sure whether to 
hug him or yell at him. 

I run back toward the ditch where I came from 
and I see a hand sticking out. “Teddy! I’m right 
here!” I call. “Reach up. I’ll pull you out.” But when 
I get closer, I see the metal glint of a silver bracelet 
with tiny cello and guitar charms. Adam gave it to 
me for my seventeenth birthday. It’s my bracelet. I 
was wearing it this morning. I look down at my 
wrist. I’m still wearing it now. 

I edge closer and now I know that it’s not Teddy 
lying there. It’s me. The blood from my chest has 
seeped through my shirt, skirt, and sweater, and is 
now pooling like paint drops on the virgin snow. 
One of my legs is askew, the skin and muscle peeled 
away so that I can see white streaks of bone. My 
eyes are closed, and my dark brown hair is wet and 
rusty with blood. 

I spin away. This isn’t right. This cannot be hap- 
pening. We are a family, going on a drive. This isn’t 




23/256 


real. I must have fallen asleep in the car. No! Stop. 
Please stop. Please wake up! I scream into the chilly 
air. It’s cold. My breath should smoke. It doesn’t. I 
stare down at my wrist, the one that looks fine, un- 
touched by blood and gore, and I pinch as hard as I 
can. 

I don’t feel a thing. 

I have had nightmares before— falling 

nightmares, playing-a-cello-recital-without- 

knowing-the-music nightmares, breakup-with- 

Adam nightmares— but I have always been able to 
command myself to open my eyes, to lift my head 
from the pillow, to halt the horror movie playing be- 
hind my closed lids. I try again. Wake up! I scream. 
Wake up! Wakeupwakeupwakeup! But I can’t. I 
don’t. 

Then I hear something. It’s the music. I can still 
hear the music. So I concentrate on that. I finger the 
notes of Beethoven’s Cello Sonata no. 3 with my 
hands, as I often do when I listen to pieces I am 
working on. Adam calls it “air cello.” He’s always 
asking me if one day we can play a duet, him on air 
guitar, me on air cello. “When we’re done, we can 
thrash our air instruments,” he jokes. “You know 
you want to.” 




24/256 


I play, just focusing on that, until the last bit of 
life in the car dies, and the music goes with it. 

It isn’t long after that the sirens come. 


9:23 A.M. 


Am I dead? 

I actually have to ask myself this. 

Am I dead? 

At first it seemed obvious that I am. That the 
standing-here-watching part was temporary, an in- 
termission before the bright light and the life- 
flashing-before-me business that would transport 
me to wherever I’m going next. 

Except the paramedics are here now, along with 
the police and the fire department. Someone has 
put a sheet over my father. And a fireman is zipping 
Mom up into a plastic bag. I hear him discuss her 
with another firefighter, who looks like he can’t be 
more than eighteen. The older one explains to the 
rookie that Mom was probably hit first and killed 
instantly, explaining the lack of blood. “Immediate 




25/256 


cardiac arrest,” he says. “When your heart can’t 
pump blood, you don’t really bleed. You seep.” 

I can’t think about that, about Mom seeping. So 
instead I think how fitting it is that she was hit first, 
that she was the one to buffer us from the blow. It 
wasn’t her choice, obviously, but it was her way. 

But am I dead? The me who is lying on the edge 
of the road, my leg hanging down into the gulley, is 
surrounded by a team of men and women who are 
performing frantic ablutions over me and plugging 
my veins with I do not know what. I’m half naked, 
the paramedics having ripped open the top of my 
shirt. One of my breasts is exposed. Embarrassed, I 
look away. 

The police have lit flares along the perimeter of 
the scene and are instructing cars in both directions 
to turn back, the road is closed. The police politely 
offer alternate routes, back roads that will take 
people where they need to be. 

They must have places to go, the people in these 
cars, but a lot of them don’t turn back. They climb 
out of their cars, hugging themselves against the 
cold. They appraise the scene. And then they look 
away, some of them crying, one woman throwing up 
into the ferns on the side of the road. And even 




26/256 


though they don’t know who we are or what has 
happened, they pray for us. I can feel them praying. 

Which also makes me think I’m dead. That and 
the fact my body seems to be completely numb, 
though to look at me, at the leg that the 60 mph as- 
phalt exfoliant has pared down to the bone, I should 
be in agony. And I’m not crying, either, even though 
I know that something unthinkable has just 
happened to my family. We are like Humpty 
Dumpty and all these king’s horses and all these 
king’s men cannot put us back together again. 

I am pondering these things when the medic with 
the freckles and red hair who has been working on 
me answers my question. “Her Glasgow Coma is an 
eight. Let’s bag her now!” she screams. 

She and the lantern-jawed medic snake a tube 
down my throat, attach a bag with a bulb to it, and 
start pumping. “What’s the ETA for Life Flight?” 

“Ten minutes,” answers the medic. “It takes 
twenty to get back to town.” 

“We’re going to get her there in fifteen if you have 
to speed like a fucking demon.” 

I can tell what the guy is thinking. That it won’t 
do me any good if they get into a crash, and I have 




27/256 


to agree. But he doesn’t say anything. Just clenches 
his jaw. They load me into the ambulance; the red- 
head climbs into the back with me. She pumps my 
bag with one hand, adjusts my IV and my monitors 
with the other. Then she smooths a lock of hair from 
my forehead. 

“You hang in there,” she tells me. 


I played my first recital when I was ten. I’d been 
playing cello for two years at that point. At first, just 
at school, as part of the music program. It was a 
fluke that they even had a cello; they’re very expens- 
ive and fragile. But some old literature professor 
from the university had died and bequeathed his 
Hamburg to our school. It mostly sat in the corner. 
Most kids wanted to learn to play guitar or 
saxophone. 

When I announced to Mom and Dad that I was 
going to become a cellist, they both burst out laugh- 
ing. They apologized about it later, claiming that the 
image of pint-size me with such a hulking instru- 
ment between my spindly legs had made them crack 


28/256 


up. Once they’d realized I was serious, they immedi- 
ately swallowed their giggles and put on supportive 
faces. 

But their reaction still stung— in ways that I never 
told them about, and in ways that I’m not sure they 
would’ve understood even if I had. Dad sometimes 
joked that the hospital where I was born must have 
accidentally swapped babies because I look nothing 
like the rest of my family. They are all blond and fair 
and I’m like their negative image, brown hair and 
dark eyes. But as I got older, Dad’s hospital joke 
took on more meaning than I think he intended. So- 
metimes I did feel like I came from a different tribe. 
I was not like my outgoing, ironic dad or my tough- 
chick mom. And as if to seal the deal, instead of 
learning to play electric guitar, I’d gone and chosen 
the cello. 

But in my family, playing music was still more 
important than the type of music you played, so 
when after a few months it became clear that my 
love for the cello was no passing crush, my parents 
rented me one so I could practice at home. Rusty 
scales and triads led to first attempts at “Twinkle, 
Twinkle, Little Star” that eventually gave way to ba- 
sic etudes until I was playing Bach suites. My 
middle school didn’t have much of a music 




29/256 


program, so Mom found me a private teacher, a col- 
lege student who came over once a week. Over the 
years there was a revolving batch of students who 
taught me, and then, as my skills surpassed theirs, 
my student teachers played with me. 

This continued until ninth grade, when Dad, 
who’d known Professor Christie from when he’d 
worked at the music store, asked if she might be 
willing to offer me private lessons. She agreed to 
listen to me play, not expecting much, but as a favor 
to Dad, she later told me. She and Dad listened 
downstairs while I was up in my room practicing a 
Vivaldi sonata. When I came down for dinner, she 
offered to take over my training. 

My first recital, though, was years before I met 
her. It was at a hall in town, a place that usually 
showcased local bands, so the acoustics were ter- 
rible for unamplified classical. I was playing a cello 
solo from Tchaikovsky’s “Dance of the Sugar Plum 
Fairy.” 

Standing backstage, listening to other kids play 
scratchy violin and clunky piano compositions, I’d 
almost chickened out. I’d run to the stage door and 
huddled on the stoop outside, hyperventilating into 




30/256 


my hands. My student teacher had flown into a 
minor panic and had sent out a search party. 

Dad found me. He was just starting his hipster- 
to-square transformation, so he was wearing a vin- 
tage suit, with a studded leather belt and black 
ankle boots. 

“You okay, Mia Oh-My-Uh?” he asked, sitting 
down next to me on the steps. 

I shook my head, too ashamed to talk. 

“What’s up?” 

“I can’t do it,” I cried. 

Dad cocked one of his bushy eyebrows and stared 
at me with his gray-blue eyes. I felt like some mys- 
terious foreign species he was observing and trying 
to figure out. He’d been playing in bands forever. 
Obviously, he never got something as lame as stage 
fright. 

“Well, that would be a shame,” Dad said. “I’ve got 
a dandy of a recital present for you. Better than 
flowers.” 

“Give it to someone else. I can’t go out there. I’m 
not like you or Mom or even Teddy.” Teddy was just 
six months old at that point, but it was already clear 




31/256 


that he had more personality, more verve, than I 
ever would. And of course, he was blond and blue- 
eyed. Even if he weren’t, he’d been born in a birth- 
ing center, not a hospital, so there was no chance of 
an accidental baby swapping. 

“It’s true,” Dad mused. “When Teddy gave his 
first harp concert, he was cool as cucumber. Such a 
prodigy.” 

I laughed through my tears. Dad put a gentle arm 
around my shoulder. “You know that I used to get 
the most ferocious jitters before a show.” 

I looked at Dad, who always seemed absolutely 
sure of everything in the world. “You’re just saying 
that.” 

He shook his head. “No, I’m not. It was god-aw- 
ful. And I was the drummer, way in the back. No 
one even paid any attention to me.” 

“So what did you do?” I asked. 

“He got wasted,” Mom interjected, poking her 
head out the stage door. She was wearing a black 
vinyl miniskirt, a red tank top, and Teddy, drool- 
ingly happy from his Baby Bjorn. “A pair of forty- 
ouncers before the show. I don’t recommend that 
for you.” 




32/256 


“Your mother is probably right,” Dad said. “Social 
services frowns on drunk ten-year-olds. Besides, 
when I dropped my drumsticks and puked onstage, 
it was punk. If you drop your bow and smell like a 
brewery, it will look gauche. You classical-music 
people are so snobby that way.” 

Now I was laughing. I was still scared, but it was 
somehow comforting to think that maybe stage 
fright was a trait I’d inherited from Dad; I wasn’t 
just some foundling, after all. 

“What if I mess it up? What if I’m terrible?” 

“I’ve got news for you, Mia. There’s going to be all 
kinds of terrible in there, so you won’t really stand 
out,” Mom said. Teddy gave a squeal of agreement. 

“But seriously, how do you get over the jitters?” 

Dad was still smiling but I could tell he had 
turned serious because he slowed down his speech. 
“You don’t. You just work through it. You just hang 
in there.” 

So I went on. I didn’t blaze through the piece. I 
didn’t achieve glory or get a standing ovation, but I 
didn’t muck it up entirely, either. And after the re- 
cital, I got my present. It was sitting in the passen- 
ger seat of the car, looking as human as that cello I’d 




33/256 


been drawn to two years earlier. It wasn’t a rental. It 
was mine. 


10:12 A.M. 

When my ambulance gets to the nearest hospit- 
al— not the one in my hometown but a small local 
place that looks more like an old-age home than a 
medical center— the medics rush me inside. “I think 
we’ve got a collapsed lung. Get a chest tube in her 
and move her out!” the nice red-haired medic 
screams as she passes me off to a team of nurses 
and doctors. 

“Where’s the rest?” asks a bearded guy in scrubs. 

“Other driver suffering mild concussions, being 
treated at the scene. Parents DOA. Boy, approxim- 
ately seven years old, just behind us.” 

I let out a huge exhale, as though I’ve been hold- 
ing my breath for the last twenty minutes. After see- 
ing myself in that ditch, I had not been able to look 
for Teddy. If he were like Mom and Dad, like me, I . 
. . I didn’t want to even think about it. But he isn’t. 
He is alive. 




34/256 


They take me into a small room with bright lights. 
A doctor dabs some orange stuff onto the side of my 
chest and then rams a small plastic tube in me. 
Another doctor shines a flashlight into my eye. 
“Nonresponsive,” he tells the nurse. “The chopper’s 
here. Get her to Trauma. Now!” 

They rush me out of the ER and into the elevator. 
I have to jog to keep up. Right before the doors 
close, I notice that Willow is here. Which is odd. We 
were meant to be visiting her and Henry and the 
baby at home. Did she get called in because of the 
snow? Because of us? She rushes around the hospit- 
al hall, her face a mask of concentration. I don’t 
think she even knows it is us yet. Maybe she even 
tried to call, left a message on Mom’s cell phone, 
apologizing that there’d been an emergency and she 
wouldn’t be home for our visit. 

The elevator opens right onto the roof. A heli- 
copter, its blades swooshing the air, sits in the 
middle of a big red circle. 

I’ve never been in a helicopter before. My best 
friend, Kim, has. She went on an aerial flight over 
Mount St. Helens once with her uncle, a big-shot 
photographer for National Geographic. 




35/256 


“There he was, talking about the post-volcanic 
flora and I puked right on him,” Kim told me in 
homeroom the next day. She still looked a little 
green from the experience. 

Kim is on yearbook and has hopes of becoming a 
photographer. Her uncle had taken her on this trip 
as a favor, to nurture her budding talent. “I even got 
some on his cameras,” Kim lamented. “I’ll never be 
a photographer now.” 

“There are all kinds of different photographers,” I 
told her. “You don’t necessarily need to go flying 
around in helicopters.” 

Kim laughed. “That’s good. Because I’m never go- 
ing on a helicopter again— and don’t you, either!” 

I want to tell Kim that sometimes you don’t have 
a choice in the matter. 

The hatch in the helicopter is opened, and my 
stretcher with all its tubes and lines is loaded in. I 
climb in behind it. A medic bounds in next to me, 
still pumping the little plastic bulb that is appar- 
ently breathing for me. Once we lift off, I under- 
stand why Kim got so queasy. A helicopter is not 
like an airplane, a smooth fast bullet. A helicopter is 
more like a hockey puck, bounced through the sky. 




36/256 


Up and down, side to side. I have no idea how these 
people can work on me, can read the small com- 
puter printouts, can drive this thing while they com- 
municate about me through headsets, how they can 
do any of it with the chopper chopping around. 

The helicopter hits an air pocket and by all rights 
it should make me queasy. But I don’t feel anything, 
at least the me who’s a bystander here does not. And 
the me on the stretcher doesn’t seem to feel any- 
thing, either. Again I have to wonder if I’m dead but 
then I tell myself no. They would not have loaded 
me on this helicopter, would not be flying me across 
the lush forests if I were dead. 

Also, if I were dead, I like to think Mom and Dad 
would’ve come for me by now. 

I can see the time on the control panel. It’s 10:37. 
I wonder what’s happening back down on the 
ground. Has Willow figured out who the emergency 
is? Has anyone phoned my grandparents? They live 
one town over from us, and I was looking forward to 
dinner with them. Gramps fishes and he smokes his 
own salmon and oysters, and we would’ve probably 
eaten that with Gran’s homemade thick brown beer 
bread. Then Gran would’ve taken Teddy over to the 
giant recycling bins in town and let him swim 




37/256 


around for magazines. Lately, he’s had a thing for 
Reader’s Digest. He likes to cut out the cartoons 
and make collages. 

I wonder about Kim. There’s no school today. I 
probably won’t be in school tomorrow. She’ll prob- 
ably think I’m absent because I stayed out late 
listening to Adam and Shooting Star in Portland. 

Portland. I am fairly certain that I’m being taken 
there. The helicopter pilot keeps talking to Trauma 
One. Outside the window, I can see the peak of 
Mount Hood looming. That means Portland is close. 

Is Adam already there? He played in Seattle last 
night but he’s always so full of adrenaline after a 
gig, and driving helps him to come down. The band 
is normally happy to let him chauffeur while they 
nap. If he’s already in Portland, he’s probably still 
asleep. When he wakes up, will he have coffee on 
Hawthorne? Maybe take a book over to the Japan- 
ese Garden? That’s what we did the last time I went 
to Portland with him, only it was warmer then. 
Later this afternoon, I know that the band will do a 
sound check. And then Adam will go outside to 
await my arrival. At first, he’ll think that I’m late. 
How is he going to know that I’m actually early? 




38/256 


That I got to Portland this morning while the snow 
was still melting? 


“Have you ever heard of this Yo-Yo Ma dude?” 
Adam asked me. It was the spring of my sophomore 
year, which was his junior year. By then, Adam had 
been watching me practice in the music wing for 
several months. Our school was public, but one of 
those progressive ones that always got written up in 
national magazines because of its emphasis on the 
arts. We did get a lot of free periods to paint in the 
studio or practice music. I spent mine in the sound- 
proof booths of the music wing. Adam was there a 
lot, too, playing guitar. Not the electric guitar he 
played in his band. Just acoustic melodies. 

I rolled my eyes. “Everyone’s heard of Yo-Yo Ma.” 

Adam grinned. I noticed for the first time that his 
smile was lopsided, his mouth sloping up on one 
side. He hooked his ringed thumb out toward the 
quad. “I don’t think you’ll find five people out there 
who’ve heard of Yo-Yo Ma. And by the way, what 


39/256 


kind of name is that? Is it ghetto or something? Yo 
Mama?” 

“It’s Chinese.” 

Adam shook his head and laughed. “I know plenty 
of Chinese people. They have names like Wei Chin. 
Or Lee something. Not Yo-Yo Ma.” 

“You cannot be blaspheming the master,” I said. 
But then I laughed in spite of myself. It had taken 
me a few months to believe that Adam wasn’t taking 
the piss out of me, and after that we’d started hav- 
ing these little conversations in the corridor. 

Still, his attention baffled me. It wasn’t that Adam 
was such a popular guy. He wasn’t a jock or a most- 
likely-to-succeed sort. But he was cool. Cool in that 
he played in a band with people who went to the 
college in town. Cool in that he had his own rockery 
style, procured from thrift stores and garage sales, 
not from Urban Outfitters knock-offs. Cool in that 
he seemed totally happy to sit in the lunchroom ab- 
sorbed in a book, not just pretending to read be- 
cause he didn’t have anywhere to sit or anyone to sit 
with. That wasn’t the case at all. He had a small 
group of friends and a large group of admirers. 




40/256 


And it wasn’t like I was a dork, either. I had 
friends and a best friend to sit with at lunch. I had 
other good friends at the music conservatory camp I 
went to in the summer. People liked me well 
enough, but they also didn’t really know me. I was 
quiet in class. I didn’t raise my hand a lot or sass the 
teachers. And I was busy, much of my time spent 
practicing or playing in a string quartet or taking 
theory classes at the community college. Kids were 
nice enough to me, but they tended to treat me as if 
I were a grown-up. Another teacher. And you don’t 
flirt with your teachers. 

“What would you say if I said I had tickets to the 
master?” Adam asked me, a glint in his eyes. 

“Shut up. You do not,” I said, shoving him a little 
harder than I’d meant to. 

Adam pretended to fall against the glass wall. 
Then he dusted himself off. “I do. At the Schnitzle 
place in Portland.” 

“It’s the Arlene Schnitzer Hall. It’s part of the 
Symphony.” 

“That’s the place. I got tickets. A pair. You 
interested?” 




41/256 


“Are you serious? Yes! I was dying to go but 
they’re like eighty dollars each. Wait, how did you 
get tickets?” 

“A friend of the family gave them to my parents, 
but they can’t go. It’s no big thing,” Adam said 
quickly. “Anyhow, it’s Friday night. If you want, I’ll 
pick you up at five-thirty and we’ll drive to Portland 
together.” 

“Okay,” I said, like it was the most natural thing. 

By Friday afternoon, though, I was more jittery 
than when I’d inadvertently drunk a whole pot of 
Dad’s tar-strong coffee while studying for finals last 
winter. 

It wasn’t Adam making me nervous. I’d grown 
comfortable enough around him by now. It was the 
uncertainty. What was this, exactly? A date? A 
friendly favor? An act of charity? I didn’t like being 
on soft ground any more than I liked fumbling my 
way through a new movement. That’s why I prac- 
ticed so much, so I could rush myself on solid 
ground and then work out the details from there. 

I changed my clothes about six times. Teddy, a 
kindergartner back then, sat in my bedroom, pulling 
the Calvin and Hobbes books down from the shelves 




42/256 


and pretending to read them. He cracked himself 
up, though I wasn’t sure whether it was Calvin’s 
high jinks or my own making him so goofy. 

Mom popped her head in to check on my pro- 
gress. “He’s just a guy, Mia,” she said when she saw 
me getting worked up. 

“Yeah, but he’s just the first guy I’ve ever gone on 
a maybe-date with,” I said. “So I don’t know wheth- 
er to wear date clothes or symphony clothes— do 
people here even dress up for that kind of thing? Or 
should I just keep it casual, in case it’s not a date?” 

“Just wear something you feel good in,” she sug- 
gested. “That way you’re covered.” I’m sure Mom 
would’ve pulled out all the stops had she been me. 
In the pictures of her and Dad from the early days, 
she looked like a cross between a 1930s siren and a 
biker chick, with her pixie haircut, her big blue eyes 
coated in kohl eyeliner, and her rail-thin body al- 
ways ensconced in some sexy getup, like a lacy vin- 
tage camisole paired with skintight leather pants. 

I sighed. I wished I could be so ballsy. In the end, 
I chose a long black skirt and a maroon short- 
sleeved sweater. Plain and simple. My trademark, I 
guess. 




43/256 


When Adam showed up in a sharkskin suit and 
Creepers (an ensemble that wholly impressed Dad), 
I realized that this really was a date. Of course, 
Adam would choose to dress up for the symphony 
and a 1960s sharkskin suit could’ve just been his 
cool take on formal, but I knew there was more to it 
than that. He seemed nervous as he shook hands 
with my dad and told him that he had his band’s old 
CDs. “To use as coasters, I hope,” Dad said. Adam 
looked surprised, unused to the parent being more 
sarcastic than the child, I imagine. 

“Don’t you kids get too crazy. Bad injuries at the 
last Yo-Yo Ma mosh pit,” Mom called as we walked 
down the lawn. 

“Your parents are so cool,” Adam said, opening 
the car door for me. 

“I know,” I replied. 


We drove to Portland, making small talk. Adam 
played me snippets of bands he liked, a Swedish pop 
trio that sounded monotonous but then some 
Icelandic art band that was quite beautiful. We got a 
little lost downtown and made it to the concert hall 
with only a few minutes to spare. 




44/256 


Our seats were in the balcony. Nosebleeds. But 
you don’t go to Yo-Yo Ma for the view, and the 
sound was incredible. That man has a way of mak- 
ing the cello sound like a crying woman one minute, 
a laughing child the next. Listening to him, I’m al- 
ways reminded of why I started playing cello in the 
first place— that there is something so human and 
expressive about it. 

When the concert started, I peered at Adam out of 
the corner of my eye. He seemed good-natured 
enough about the whole thing, but he kept looking 
at his program, probably counting off the move- 
ments until intermission. I worried that he was 
bored, but after a while I got too caught up in the 
music to care. 

Then, when Yo-Yo Ma played “Le Grand Tango,” 
Adam reached over and grasped my hand. In any 
other context, this would have been cheesy, the old 
yawn-and-cop-a-feel move. But Adam wasn’t look- 
ing at me. His eyes were closed and he was swaying 
slightly in his seat. He was lost in the music, too. I 
squeezed his hand back and we sat there like that 
for the rest of the concert. 




45/256 


Afterward, we bought coffees and doughnuts and 
walked along the river. It was misting and he took 
off his suit jacket and draped it over my shoulders. 

“You didn’t really get those tickets from a family 
friend, did you?” I asked. 

I thought he would laugh or throw up his arm in 
mock surrender like he did when I beat him in an 
argument. But he looked straight at me, so I could 
see the green and browns and grays swimming 
around in his irises. He shook his head. “That was 
two weeks of pizza-delivery tips,” he admitted. 

I stopped walking. I could hear the water lapping 
below. “Why?” I asked. “Why me?” 

“I’ve never seen anyone get as into music as you 
do. It’s why I like to watch you practice. You get the 
cutest crease in your forehead, right there,” Adam 
said, touching me above the bridge of my nose. “I’m 
obsessed with music and even I don’t get transpor- 
ted like you do.” 

“So, what? I’m like a social experiment to you?” I 
meant it to be jokey, but it came out sounding 
bitter. 

“No, you’re not an experiment,” Adam said. His 
voice was husky and choked. 




46/256 


I felt the heat flood my neck and I could sense 
myself blushing. I stared at my shoes. I knew that 
Adam was looking at me now with as much cer- 
tainty as I knew that if I looked up he was going to 
kiss me. And it took me by surprise how much I 
wanted to be kissed by him, to realize that I’d 
thought about it so often that I’d memorized the ex- 
act shape of his lips, that I’d imagined running my 
finger down the cleft of his chin. 

My eyes flickered upward. Adam was there wait- 
ing for me. 

That was how it started. 


12:19 P.M. 

There are a lot of things wrong with me. 

Apparently, I have a collapsed lung. A ruptured 
spleen. Internal bleeding of unknown origin. And 
most serious, the contusions on my brain. I’ve also 
got broken ribs. Abrasions on my legs, which will 
require skin grafts; and on my face, which will 




47/256 


require cosmetic surgery— but, as the doctors note, 
that is only if I am lucky. 

Right now, in surgery, the doctors have to remove 
my spleen, insert a new tube to drain my collapsed 
lung, and stanch whatever else might be causing the 
internal bleeding. There isn’t a lot they can do for 
my brain. 

“We’ll just wait and see,” one of the surgeons 
says, looking at the CAT scan of my head. “In the 
meantime, call down to the blood bank. I need two 
units of O neg and keep two units ahead.” 

O negative. My blood type. I had no idea. It’s not 
like it’s something I’ve ever had to think about be- 
fore. I’ve never been in the hospital unless you 
count the time I went to the emergency room after I 
cut my ankle on some broken glass. I didn’t even 
need stitches then, just a tetanus shot. 

In the operating room, the doctors are debating 
what music to play, just like we were in the car this 
morning. One guy wants jazz. Another wants rock. 
The anesthesiologist, who stands near my head, re- 
quests classical. I root for her, and I feel like that 
must help because someone pops on a Wagner CD, 
although I don’t know that the rousing “Ride of the 




48/256 


Valkyries” is what I had in mind. I’d hoped for 
something a little lighter. Four Seasons, perhaps. 

The operating room is small and crowded, full of 
blindingly bright lights, which highlight how grubby 
this place is. It’s nothing like on TV, where operat- 
ing rooms are like pristine theaters that could ac- 
commodate an opera singer, and an audience. The 
floor, though buffed shiny, is dingy with scuff marks 
and rust streaks, which I take to be old bloodstains. 

Blood. It is everywhere. It does not faze the doc- 
tors one bit. They slice and sew and suction through 
a river of it, like they are washing dishes in soapy 
water. Meanwhile, they pump an ever-replenishing 
stock into my veins. 

The surgeon who wanted to listen to rock sweats a 
lot. One of the nurses has to periodically dab him 
with gauze that she holds in tongs. At one point, he 
sweats through his mask and has to replace it. 

The anesthesiologist has gentle fingers. She sits at 
my head, keeping an eye on all my vitals, adjusting 
the amounts of the fluids and gases and drugs 
they’re giving me. She must be doing a good job be- 
cause I don’t appear to feel anything, even though 
they are yanking at my body. It’s rough and messy 
work, nothing like that game Operation we used to 




49/256 


play as kids where you had to be careful not touch 
the sides as you removed a bone, or the buzzer 
would go off. 

The anesthesiologist absentmindedly strokes my 
temples through her latex gloves. This is what Mom 
used to do when I came down with the flu or got one 
of those headaches that hurt so bad I used to ima- 
gine cutting open a vein in my temple just to relieve 
the pressure. 

The Wagner CD has repeated twice now. The doc- 
tors decide it’s time for a new genre. Jazz wins. 
People always assume that because I am into clas- 
sical music, I’m a jazz aficionado. I’m not. Dad is. 
He loves it, especially the wild, latter-day Coltrane 
stuff. He says that jazz is punk for old people. I 
guess that explains it, because I don’t like punk, 
either. 

The operation goes on and on. I’m exhausted by 
it. I don’t know how the doctors have the stamina to 
keep up. They’re standing still, but it seems harder 
than running a marathon. 

I start to zone out. And then I start to wonder 
about this state I’m in. If I’m not dead— and the 
heart monitor is bleeping along, so I assume I’m 
not— but I’m not in my body, either, can I go 




50/256 


anywhere? Am I a ghost? Could I transport myself 
to a beach in Hawaii? Can I pop over to Carnegie 
Hall in New York City? Can I go to Teddy? 

Just for the sake of experiment, I wiggle my nose 
like Samantha on Bewitched. Nothing happens. I 
snap my fingers. Click my heels. I’m still here. 

I decide to try a simpler maneuver. I walk into the 
wall, imagining that I’ll float through it and come 
out the other side. Except that what happens when I 
walk into the wall is that I hit a wall. 

A nurse bustles in with a bag of blood, and before 
the door shuts behind her, I slip through it. Now I’m 
in the hospital corridor. There are lots of doctors 
and nurses in blue and green scrubs hustling 
around. A woman on a gurney, her hair in a gauzy 
blue shower cap, an IV in her arm, calls out, “Willi- 
am, William.” I walk a little farther. There are rows 
of operating rooms, all full of sleeping people. If the 
patients inside these rooms are like me, why then 
can’t I see the people outside the people? Is every- 
one else loitering about like I seem to be? I’d really 
like to meet someone in my condition. I have some 
questions, like, what is this state I’m in exactly and 
how do I get out of it? How do I get back to my 
body? Do I have to wait for the doctors to wake me 




51/256 


up? But there’s no one else like me around. Maybe 
the rest of them figured out how to get to Hawaii. 

I follow a nurse through a set of automatic double 
doors. I’m in a small waiting room now. My grand- 
parents are here. 

Gran is chattering away to Gramps, or maybe just 
to the air. It’s her way of not letting emotion get the 
best of her. I’ve seen her do it before, when Gramps 
had a heart attack. She is wearing her Wellies and 
her gardening smock, which is smudged with mud. 
She must have been working in her greenhouse 
when she heard about us. Gran’s hair is short and 
curly and gray; she’s been wearing it in a permanent 
wave, Dad says, since the 1970s. “It’s easy,” Gran 
says. “No muss, no fuss.” This is so typical of her. 
No nonsense. She’s so quintessentially practical that 
most people would never guess she has a thing for 
angels. She keeps a collection of ceramic angels, 
yarn-doll angels, blown-glass angels, you-name-it 
angels, in a special china hutch in her sewing room. 
And she doesn’t just collect angels; she believes in 
them. She thinks that they’re everywhere. Once, a 
pair of loons nested in the pond in the woods be- 
hind their house. Gran was convinced that it was 
her long-dead parents, come to watch over her.

Another time, we were sitting outside on her 
porch and I saw a red bird. “Is that a red crossbill?” 
I’d asked Gran. 

She’d shaken her head. “My sister Gloria is a 
crossbill,” Gran had said, referring to my recently 
deceased great-aunt Glo, with whom Gran had nev- 
er gotten along. “She wouldn’t be coming around 
here.” 

Gramps is staring into the dregs of his Styrofoam 
cup, peeling away the top of it so that little white 
balls collect in his lap. I can tell it’s the worst kind of 
swill, the kind that looks like it was brewed in 1997 
and has been sitting on a burner ever since. Even so, 
I wouldn’t mind a cup. 

You can draw a straight line from Gramps to Dad 
to Teddy, although Gramps’s wavy hair has gone 
from blond to gray and he is stockier than Teddy, 
who is a stick, and Dad, who is wiry and muscular 
from afternoon weight-lifting sessions at the Y. But 
they all have the same watery gray-blue eyes, the 
color of the ocean on a cloudy day. 

Maybe this is why I now find it hard to look at 
Gramps. 




53/256 


Juilliard was Gran’s idea. She’s from Massachusetts 
originally, but she moved to Oregon in 1955, on her 
own. Now that would be no big deal, but I guess 
fifty-two years ago it was kind of scandalous for a 
twenty-two-year-old unmarried woman to do that 
kind of thing. Gran claimed she was drawn to wild 
open wilderness and it didn’t get more wild than the 
endless forests and craggy beaches of Oregon. She 
got a job as a secretary working for the Forest Ser- 
vice. Gramps was working there as a biologist. 

We go back to Massachusetts sometimes in the 
summers, to a lodge in the western part of the state 
that for one week is taken over by Gran’s extended 
family. That’s when I see the second cousins and 
great aunts and uncles whose names I barely recog- 
nize. I have lots of family in Oregon, but they’re all 
from Gramps’s side. 

Last summer at the Massachusetts retreat, I 
brought my cello so I could keep up my practicing 
for an upcoming chamber-music concert. The flight 
wasn’t full, so the stewardesses let it travel in a seat 
next to me, just like the pros do it. Teddy thought 
this was hilarious and kept trying to feed it pretzels. 


54/256 


At the lodge, I gave a little concert one night, in 
the main room, with my relatives and the dead 
game animals mounted on the wall as my audience. 
It was after that that someone mentioned Juilliard, 
and Gran became taken with the idea. 

At first, it seemed far-fetched. There was a per- 
fectly good music program at the university near us. 
And, if I wanted to stretch, there was a conservatory 
in Seattle, which was only a few hours’ drive. Juil- 
liard was across the country. And expensive. Mom 
and Dad were intrigued with the idea of it, but I 
could tell neither one of them really wanted to relin- 
quish me to New York City or go into hock so that I 
could maybe become a cellist for some second-rate 
small-town orchestra. They had no idea whether I 
was good enough. In fact, neither did I. Professor 
Christie told me that I was one of the most prom- 
ising students she’d ever taught, but she’d never 
mentioned Juilliard to me. Juilliard was for virtuoso 
musicians, and it seemed arrogant to even think 
that they’d give me a second glance. 

But after the retreat, when someone else, 
someone impartial and from the East Coast, 
deemed me Juilliard-worthy, the idea burrowed in- 
to Gran’s brain. She took it upon herself to speak to 




55/256 


Professor Christie about it, and my teacher took 
hold of the idea like a terrier to a bone. 

So, I filled out my application, collected my letters 
of recommendation, and sent in a recording of my 
playing. I didn’t tell Adam about any of this. I had 
told myself that it was because there was no point 
advertising it when even getting an audition was 
such a long shot. But even then I’d recognized that 
for the lie that it was. A small part of me felt like 
even applying was some kind of betrayal. Juilliard 
was in New York. Adam was here. 

But not at high school anymore. He was a year 
ahead of me, and this past year, my senior year, he’d 
started at the university in town. He only went to 
school part-time now because Shooting Star was 
starting to get popular. There was a record deal with 
a Seattle-based label, and a lot of traveling to gigs. 
So only after I got the creamy envelope embossed 
with The Juilliard School and a letter inviting me to 
audition did I tell Adam that I’d applied. I explained 
how many people didn’t get that far. At first he 
looked a little awestruck, like he couldn’t quite be- 
lieve it. Then he gave a sad little smile. “Yo Mama 
better watch his back,” he said. 




56/256 


The auditions were held in San Francisco. Dad had 
some big conference at the school that week and 
couldn’t get away, and Mom had just started a new 
job at the travel agency, so Gran volunteered to ac- 
company me. “We’ll make a girls’ weekend of it. 
Take high tea at the Fairmont. Go window-shopping 
in Union Square. Ride the ferry to Alcatraz. We’ll be 
tourists.” 

But a week before we were due to leave, Gran 
tripped over a tree root and sprained her ankle. She 
had to wear one of those clunky boots and wasn’t 
supposed to walk. Minor panic ensued. I said I 
could just go by myself— drive, or take the train, and 
come right back. 

It was Gramps who insisted on taking me. We 
drove down together in his pickup truck. We didn’t 
talk much, which was fine by me because I was so 
nervous. I kept fingering the Popsicle-stick good- 
luck talisman Teddy had presented me with before 
we left. “Break an arm,” he’d told me. 

Gramps and I listened to classical music and farm 
reports on the radio when we could pick up a sta- 
tion. Otherwise, we sat in silence. But it was such a 
calming silence; it made me relax and feel closer to 
him than any heart-to-heart would have. 




57/256 


Gran had booked us in a really frilly inn, and it 
was funny to see Gramps in his work boots and 
plaid flannel amid all the lacy doilies and potpourri. 
But he took it all in stride. 

The audition was grueling. I had to play five 
pieces: a Shostakovich concerto, two Bach suites, all 
Tchaikovsky’s Pezzo capriccioso, which was next to 
impossible, and a movement from Ennio Mor- 
ricone’s The Mission, a fun but risky choice because 
Yo-Yo Ma had covered this and everyone would 
compare. I walked out with my legs wobbly and my 
underarms wet with sweat. But my endorphins were 
surging and that, combined with the huge sense of 
relief, left me totally giddy. 

“Shall we see the town?” Gramps asked, his lips 
twitching into a smile. 

“Definitely!” 

We did all the things Gran had promised we 
would do. Gramps took me to high tea and shop- 
ping, although for dinner, we skipped out on the re- 
servations Gran had made at some fancy place on 
Fisherman’s Wharf and instead wandered into Ch- 
inatown, looking for the restaurant with the longest 
line of people waiting outside, and ate there. 




58/256 


When we got back home, Gramps dropped me off 
and enveloped me in a hug. Normally, he was a 
handshaker, maybe a back-patter on really special 
occasions. His hug was strong and tight, and I knew 
it was his way of telling me that he’d had a wonder- 
ful time. 

“Me, too, Gramps,” I whispered. 


3:47 P.M. 

They just moved me out of the recovery room into 
the trauma intensive-care unit, or ICU. It’s a 
horseshoe-shaped room with about a dozen beds 
and a cadre of nurses, who constantly bustle 
around, reading the computer printouts that churn 
out from the feet of our beds recording our vital 
signs. In the middle of the room are more com- 
puters and a big desk, where another nurse sits. 

I have two nurses who check in on me, along with 
the endless round of doctors. One is a taciturn 
doughy man with blond hair and a mustache, who I 
don’t much like. And the other is a woman with skin 
so black it’s blue and a lilt in her voice. She calls me 
“sweetheart” and perpetually straightens the 




59/256 


blankets around me, even though it’s not like I’m 
kicking them off. 

There are so many tubes attached to me that I 
cannot count them all: one down my throat breath- 
ing for me; one down my nose, keeping my stomach 
empty; one in my vein, hydrating me; one in my 
bladder, peeing for me; several on my chest, record- 
ing my heartbeat; another on my finger, recording 
my pulse. The ventilator that’s doing my breathing 
has a soothing rhythm like a metronome, in, out, in, 
out. 

No one, aside from the doctors and nurses and a 
social worker, has been in to see me. It’s the social 
worker who speaks to Gran and Gramps in hushed 
sympathetic tones. She tells them that I am in 
“grave” condition. I’m not entirely sure what that 
means— grave. On TV, patients are always critical, 
or stable. Grave sounds bad. Grave is where you go 
when things don’t work out here. 

“I wish there was something we could do,” Gran 
says. “I feel so useless just waiting.” 

“I’ll see if I can get you in to see her in a little 
while,” the social worker says. She has frizzy gray 
hair and a coffee stain on her blouse; her face is 
kind. “She’s still sedated from the surgery and she’s 




60/256 


on a ventilator to help her breathe while her body 
heals from the trauma. But it can be helpful even for 
patients in a comatose state to hear from their loved 
ones.” 

Gramps grunts in reply. 

“Do you have any people you can call?” the social 
worker asks. “Relatives who might like to be here 
with you. I understand this must be quite a trial for 
you, but the stronger you can be, the more it will 
help Mia.” 

I startle when I hear the social worker say my 
name. It’s a jarring reminder that it’s me they’re 
talking about. Gran tells her about the various 
people who are en route right now, aunts, uncles. I 
don’t hear any mention of Adam. 

Adam is the one I really want to see. I wish I knew 
where he was so I could try to go there. I have no 
idea how he’s going to find out about me. Gran and 
Gramps don’t have his phone number. They don’t 
carry cell phones, so he can’t call them. And I don’t 
know how he’d even know to call them. The people 
who would normally pass along pertinent informa- 
tion that something has happened to me are in no 
position to do that. 




61/256 


I stand over the bleeping tubed lifeless form that 
is me. My skin is gray. My eyes are taped shut. I 
wish someone would take the tape off. It looks like it 
itches. The nice nurse bustles over. Her scrubs have 
lollipops on them, even though this isn’t a pediatric 
unit. “How’s it going, sweetheart?” she asks me, as if 
we just bumped into each other in the grocery store. 


It didn’t start out so smoothly with Adam and me. I 
think I had this notion that love conquers all. And 
by the time he dropped me off from the Yo-Yo Ma 
concert, I think we were both aware that we were 
falling in love. I thought that getting to this part was 
the challenge. In books and movies, the stories al- 
ways end when the two people finally have their ro- 
mantic kiss. The happily-ever-after part is just 
assumed. 

It didn’t quite work that way for us. It turned out 
that coming from such far corners of the social uni- 
verse had its downsides. We continued to see each 
other in the music wing, but these interactions re- 
mained platonic, as if neither one of us wanted to 
mess with a good thing. But whenever we met at 


62/256 


other places in the school— when we sat together in 
the cafeteria or studied side by side on the quad on 
a sunny day— something was off. We were uncom- 
fortable. Conversation was stilted. One of us would 
say something and the other would start to say 
something else at the same time. 

“You go,” I’d say. 

“No, you go,” Adam would say. 

The politeness was painful. I wanted to push 
through it, to return to the glow of the night of the 
concert, but I was unsure of how to get back there. 

Adam invited me to see his band play. This was 
even worse than school. If I felt like a fish out of wa- 
ter in my family, I felt like a fish on Mars in Adam’s 
circle. He was always surrounded by funky, lively 
people, by cute girls with dyed hair and piercings, 
by aloof guys who perked up when Adam rock- 
talked with them. I couldn’t do the groupie thing. 
And I didn’t know how to rock-talk at all. It was a 
language I should’ve understood, being both a mu- 
sician and Dad’s daughter, but I didn’t. It was like 
how Mandarin speakers can sort of understand 
Cantonese but not really, even though non-Chinese 
people assume all Chinese can communicate with 




63/256 


one another, even though Mandarin and Cantonese 
are actually different. 

I dreaded going to shows with Adam. It wasn’t 
that I was jealous. Or that I wasn’t into his kind of 
music. I loved to watch him play. When he was on- 
stage, it was like the guitar was a fifth limb, a natur- 
al extension of his body. And when he came offstage 
afterward, he would be sweaty but it was such a 
clean sweat that part of me was tempted to lick the 
side of his face, like it was a lollipop. I didn’t, 
though. 

Once the fans would descend, I’d skitter off to the 
sidelines. Adam would try to draw me back, to wrap 
an arm around my waist, but I’d disentangle myself 
and head back to the shadows. 

“Don’t you like me anymore?” Adam chided me 
after one show. He was kidding, but I could hear the 
hurt behind the offhand question. 

“I don’t know if I should keep coming to your 
shows,” I said. 

“Why not?” he asked. This time he didn’t try to 
disguise the hurt. 

“I feel like I keep you from basking in it all. I don’t 
want you to have to worry about me.” 




64/256 


Adam said that he didn’t mind worrying about 
me, but I could tell that part of him did. 


We probably would’ve broken up in those early 
weeks were it not for my house. At my house, with 
my family, we found a common ground. After we’d 
been together for a month, I took Adam home with 
me for his first family dinner with us. He sat in the 
kitchen with Dad, rock-talking. I observed, and I 
still didn’t understand half of it, but unlike at the 
shows I didn’t feel left out. 

“Do you play basketball?” Dad asked. When it 
came to observing sports, Dad was a baseball fanat- 
ic, but when it came to playing, he loved to shoot 
hoops. 

“Sure,” Adam said. “I mean, I’m not very good.” 

“You don’t need to be good; you just need to be 
committed. Want to play a quick game? You already 
have your basketball shoes on,” Dad said, looking at 
Adam’s Converse high-tops. Then he turned to me. 
“You mind?” 

“Not at all,” I said, smiling. “I can practice while 
you play.” 




65/256 


They went out to the courts behind the nearby 
elementary school. They returned forty-five minutes 
later. Adam was covered with a sheen of sweat and 
looking a little dazed. 

“What happened?” I asked. “Did the old man 
whoop you?” 

Adam shook his head and nodded at the same 
time. “Well, yes. But it’s not that. I got stung by a 
bee on my palm while we were playing. Your dad 
grabbed my hand and sucked the venom out.” 

I nodded. This was a trick he’d learned from 
Gran, and unlike with rattlesnakes, it actually 
worked on bee stings. You got the stinger and the 
venom out, so you were left with only a little itch. 

Adam broke into an embarrassed smile. He 
leaned in and whispered into my ear: “I think I’m a 
little wigged out that I’ve been more intimate with 
your dad than I have with you.” 

I laughed at that. But it was sort of true. In the 
few weeks we’d been together, we hadn’t done much 
more than kiss. It wasn’t that I was a prude. I was a 
virgin, but I certainly wasn’t devoted to staying that 
way. And Adam certainly wasn’t a virgin. It was 




66/256 


more that our kissing had suffered from the same 
painful politeness as our conversations. 

“Maybe we should remedy that,” I murmured. 

Adam raised his eyebrows as if asking me a ques- 
tion. I blushed in response. All through dinner, we 
grinned at each other as we listened to Teddy, who 
was chattering about the dinosaur bones he’d ap- 
parently dug up in the back garden that afternoon. 
Dad had made his famous salt roast, which was my 
favorite dish, but I had no appetite. I pushed the 
food around my plate, hoping no one would notice. 
All the while, this little buzz was building inside me. 
I thought of the tuning fork I used to adjust my 
cello. Hitting it sets off vibrations in the note of 
A— vibrations that keep growing, and growing, until 
the harmonic pitch fills up the room. That’s what 
Adam’s grin was doing to me during dinner. 


After the meal, Adam took a quick peek at Teddy’s 
fossil finds, and then we went upstairs to my room 
and closed the door. Kim is not allowed to be alone 
in her house with boys— not that the opportunity 
ever came up. My parents had never mentioned any 
rules on this issue, but I had a feeling that they 
knew what was happening with Adam and me, and 




67/256 


even though Dad liked to play it all Father Knows 
Best, in reality, he and Mom were suckers when it 
came to love. 

Adam lay down on my bed, stretching his arms 
above his head. His whole face was grinning— eyes, 
nose, mouth. “Play me,” he said. 

“What?” 

“I want you to play me like a cello.” 

I started to protest that this made no sense, but 
then I realized it made perfect sense. I went to my 
closet and grabbed one of my spare bows. “Take off 
your shirt,” I said, my voice quavering. 

Adam did. As thin as he was, he was surprisingly 
built. I could’ve spent twenty minutes staring at the 
contours and valleys of his chest. But he wanted me 
closer. I wanted me closer. 

I sat down next to him on the bed so his long 
body was stretched out in front of me. The bow 
trembled as I placed it on the bed. I reached with 
my left hand and caressed Adam’s head as if it were 
the scroll of my cello. He smiled again and closed 
his eyes. I relaxed a little. I fiddled with his ears as 
though they were the string pegs and then I play- 
fully tickled him as he laughed softly. I placed two 




68/2 5 6 


fingers on his Adam’s apple. Then, taking a deep 
breath for courage, I plunged into his chest. I ran 
my hands up and down the length of his torso, fo- 
cusing on the sinews in his muscles, assigning each 
one a string— A, G, C, D. I traced them down, one at 
a time, with the tip of my fingers. Adam got quiet 
then, as if he were concentrating on something. 

I reached for the bow and brushed it across his 
hips, where I imagined the bridge of the cello would 
be. I played lightly at first and then with more force 
and speed as the song now playing in my head in- 
creased in intensity. Adam lay perfectly still, little 
groans escaping from his lips. I looked at the bow, 
looked at my hands, looked at Adam’s face, and felt 
this surge of love, lust, and an unfamiliar feeling of 
power. I had never known that I could make 
someone feel this way. 

When I finished, he stood up and kissed me long 
and deep. “My turn,” he said. He pulled me to my 
feet and started by slipping the sweater over my 
head and edging down my jeans. Then he sat down 
on the bed and laid me across his lap. At first Adam 
did nothing except hold me. I closed my eyes and 
tried to feel his eyes on my body, seeing me as no 
one else ever had. 




69/256 


Then he began to play. 

He strummed chords across the top of my chest, 
which tickled and made me laugh. He gently 
brushed his hands, moving farther down. I stopped 
giggling. The tuning fork intensified— its vibrations 
growing every time Adam touched me somewhere 
new. 

After a while he switched to more of a Spanish- 
style, fingerpicking type of playing. He used the top 
of my body as the fret board, caressing my hair, my 
face, my neck. He plucked at my chest and my belly, 
but I could feel him in places his hands were 
nowhere near. As he played on, the energy magni- 
fied; the tuning fork going crazy now, firing off vi- 
brations all over, until my entire body was hum- 
ming, until I was left breathless. And when I felt like 
I could not take it one more minute, the swirl of 
sensations hit a dizzying crescendo, sending every 
nerve ending in my body on high alert. 

I opened my eyes, savoring the warm calm that 
was sweeping over me. I started to laugh. Adam did, 
too. We kissed for a while longer until it was time 
for him to go home. 

As I walked him out to his car, I wanted to tell 
him that I loved him. But it seemed like such a 




70/256 


cliche after what we’d just done. So I waited and 
told him the next day. “That’s a relief. I thought you 
might just be using me for sex,” he joked, smiling. 

After that, we still had our problems, but being 
overly polite with each other wasn’t one of them. 


4:39 P.M. 

I have quite the crowd now. Gran and Gramps. 
Uncle Greg. Aunt Diane. Aunt Kate. My cousins 
Heather and John and David. Dad is one of five 
kids, so there are still lots more relatives out there. 
Nobody is talking about Teddy, which leads me to 
believe that he’s not here. He’s probably still at the 
other hospital, being taken care of by Willow. 

The relatives gather in the hospital waiting room. 
Not the little one on the surgical floor where Gran 
and Gramps were during my operation, but a larger 
one on the hospital’s main floor that is tastefully 
decorated in shades of mauve and has comfy chairs 
and sofas and magazines that are almost current. 




71/256 


Everyone still talks in hushed tones, as if being re- 
spectful of the other people waiting, even though it’s 
only my family in the waiting room. It’s all so seri- 
ous, so ominous. I go back into the hallway to get a 
break. 

I’m so happy when Kim arrives; happy to see the 
familiar sight of her long black hair in a single braid. 
She wears the braid every day and always, by lunch- 
time, the curls and ringlets of her thick mane have 
managed to escape in rebellious little tendrils. But 
she refuses to surrender to that hair of hers, and 
every morning, it goes back into the braid. 

Kim’s mother is with her. She doesn’t let Kim 
drive long distances, and I guess that after what’s 
happened, there’s no way she’d make an exception 
today. Mrs. Schein is red-faced and blotchy, like 
she’s been crying or is about to cry. I know this be- 
cause I have seen her cry many times. She’s very 
emotional. “Drama queen,” is how Kim puts it. “It’s 
the Jewish-mother gene. She can’t help it. I suppose 
I’ll be like that one day, too,” Kim concedes. 

Kim is so the opposite of that, so droll and funny 
in a low-key way that she’s always having to say 
“just kidding” to people who don’t get her sarcastic 
sense of humor, that I cannot imagine her ever 




72/256 


being like her mother. Then again, I don’t have 
much basis for comparison. There are not a lot of 
Jewish mothers in our town or that many Jewish 
kids at our school. And the kids who are Jewish are 
usually only half, so all it means is that they have a 
menorah alongside their Christmas trees. 

But Kim is really Jewish. Sometimes I have 
Friday-night dinner with her family when they light 
candles, eat braided bread, and drink wine (the only 
time I can imagine neurotic Mrs. Schein allowing 
Kim to drink). Kim’s expected to only date Jewish 
guys, which means she doesn’t date. She jokes that 
this is the reason her family moved here, when in 
fact it was because her father was hired to run a 
computer-chip plant. When she was thirteen, she 
had a bat mitzvah at a temple in Portland, and dur- 
ing the candlelighting ceremony at the reception, I 
got called up to light one. Every summer, she goes 
to Jewish sleepaway camp in New Jersey. It’s called 
Camp Torah Habonim, but Kim calls it Torah 
Whore, because all the kids do all summer is hook 
up. 

“Just like band camp,” she joked, though my 
summer conservatory program is nothing like 
American Pie. 




73/256 


Right now I can see Kim is annoyed. She’s walk- 
ing fast, keeping a good ten feet between her and 
her mother as they march down the halls. Suddenly 
her shoulders go up like a cat that’s just spied a dog. 
She swerves to face her mother. 

“Stop it!” Kim demands. “If I’m not crying, there’s 
no fucking way you’re allowed to.” 

Kim never curses. So this shocks me. 

“But,” Mrs. Schein protests, “how can you be so . . 
.” —sob— “so calm when—” 

“Cut it out!” Kim interjects. “Mia is still here. So 
I’m not losing it. And if I don’t lose it, you don’t get 
to!” 

Kim stalks off in the direction of the waiting 
room, her mother following limply behind. When 
they reach the waiting room and see my assembled 
family, Mrs. Schein starts sniffling. 

Kim doesn’t curse this time. But her ears go pink, 
which is how I know she’s still furious. “Mother. I 
am going to leave you here. I’m taking a walk. I’ll be 
back later.” 

I follow her back out into the corridor. She 
wanders around the main lobby, loops around the 
gift shop, visits the cafeteria. She looks at the 




74/256 


hospital directory. I think I know where she’s 
headed before she does. 

There’s a small chapel in the basement. It’s 
hushed in there, a library kind of quiet. There are 
plush chairs like the kind you find at a movie theat- 
er, and a muted soundtrack playing some New 
Agey-type music. 

Kim slumps back in one of the chairs. She takes 
off her coat, the one that is black and velvet and that 
I have coveted since she bought it at some mall in 
New Jersey on a trip to visit her grandparents. 

“I love Oregon,” she says with a hiccup attempt at 
a laugh. I can tell by her sarcastic tone that it’s me 
she’s talking to, not God. “This is the hospital’s idea 
of nondenominational.” She points around the 
chapel. There is a crucifix mounted on the wall, a 
flag of a cross draped over the lectern, and a few 
paintings of the Madonna and Child hanging in the 
back. “We have a token Star of David,” she says, 
gesturing to the six-pointed star on the wall. “But 
what about the Muslims? No prayer rugs or symbol 
to show which way is east toward Mecca? And what 
about the Buddhists? Couldn’t they spring for a 
gong? I mean there are probably more Buddhists 
than Jews in Portland anyway.” 




75/256 


I sit down in a chair beside her. It feels so natural 
the way that Kim is talking to me like she always 
does. Other than the paramedic who told me to 
hang in there and the nurse who keeps asking me 
how I’m doing, no one has talked to me since the ac- 
cident. They talk about me. 

I’ve never actually seen Kim pray. I mean, she 
prayed at her bat mitzvah and she does the bless- 
ings at Shabbat dinner, but that is because she has 
to. Mostly, she makes light of her religion. But after 
she talks to me for a while, she closes her eyes and 
moves her lips and murmurs things in a language I 
don’t understand. 

She opens her eyes and wipes her hands together 
as if to say enough of that. Then she reconsiders 
and adds a final appeal. “Please don’t die. I can un- 
derstand why you’d want to, but think about this: If 
you die, there’s going to be one of those cheesy Prin- 
cess Diana memorials at school, where everyone 
puts flowers and candles and notes next to your 
locker.” She wipes away a renegade tear with the 
back of her hand. “I know you’d hate that kind of 
thing.” 




76/256 


Maybe it was because we were too alike. As soon as 
Kim showed up on the scene, everyone assumed 
we’d be best friends just because we were both dark, 
quiet, studious, and, at least outwardly, serious. The 
thing was, neither one of us was a particularly great 
student (straight B averages all around) or, for that 
matter, all that serious. We were serious about cer- 
tain things— music in my case, art and photography 
in hers— and in the simplified world of middle 
school, that was enough to set us apart as separated 
twins of some sort. 

Immediately we got shoved together for 
everything. On Kim’s third day of school, she was 
the only person to volunteer to be a team captain 
during a soccer match in PE, which I’d thought was 
beyond suck-uppy of her. As she put on her red jer- 
sey, the coach scanned the class to pick Team B’s 
captain, his eyes settling on me, even though I was 
one of the least athletic girls. As I shuffled over to 
put on my jersey, I brushed past Kim, mumbling 
“thanks a lot.” 


77/256 


The following week, our English teacher paired us 
together for a joint oral discussion on To Kill a 
Mockingbird. We sat across from each other in 
stony silence for about ten minutes. Finally, I said. 
“I guess we should talk about racism in the Old 
South, or something.” 

Kim ever so slightly rolled her eyes, which made 
me want to throw a dictionary at her. I was caught 
off guard by how intensely I already hated her. “I 
read this book at my old school,” she said. “The ra- 
cism thing is kind of obvious. I think the bigger 
thing is people’s goodness. Are they naturally good 
and turned bad by stuff like racism or are they nat- 
urally bad and need to work hard not to be?” 

“Whatever,” I said. “It’s a stupid book.” I didn’t 
know why I’d said that because I’d actually loved 
the book and had talked to Dad about it; he was us- 
ing it for his student teaching. I hated Kim even 
more for making me betray a book I loved. 

“Fine. We’ll do your idea, then,” Kim said, and 
when we got a B minus, she seemed to gloat about 
our mediocre grade. 

After that, we just didn’t talk. That didn’t stop 
teachers from pairing us together or everyone in the 
school from assuming that we were friends. The 




78/256 


more that happened, the more we resented it— and 
each other. The more the world shoved us together, 
the more we shoved back— and against each other. 
We tried to pretend the other didn’t exist even 
though the existence of our nemeses kept us both 
occupied for hours. 

I felt compelled to give myself reasons why I 
hated Kim: She was a Goody Two-shoes. She was 
annoying. She was a show-off. Later, I found out 
that she did the same thing about me, though her 
major complaint was that she thought I was a bitch. 
And one day, she even wrote it to me. In English 
class, someone flung a folded-up square of notebook 
paper onto the floor next to my right foot. I picked it 
up and opened it. It read, Bitch! 

Nobody had ever called me that before, and 
though I was automatically furious, deep down I 
was also flattered that I had elicited enough emo- 
tion to be worthy of the name. People called Mom 
that a lot, probably because she had a hard time 
holding her tongue and could be brutally blunt 
when she disagreed with you. She’d explode like a 
thunderstorm, and then be fine again. Anyhow, she 
didn’t care that people called her a bitch. “It’s just 
another word for feminist,” she told me with pride. 
Even Dad called her that sometimes, but always in a 




79/256 


jokey, complimentary way. Never during a fight. He 
knew better. 

I looked up from my grammar book. There was 
only one person who would’ve sent this note to me, 
but I still scarcely believed it. I peered at the class. 
Everyone had their faces in their books. Except for 
Kim. Her ears were so red that it made the little 
sideburnlike tendrils of dark hair look like they were 
also blushing. She was glaring at me. I might have 
been eleven years old and a little socially immature, 
but I recognized a gauntlet being thrown down 
when I saw it, and I had no choice but to take it up. 

When we got older, we liked to joke that we were 
so glad we had that fistfight. Not only did it cement 
our friendship but it also provided us our first and 
likely only opportunity for a good brawl. When else 
were two girls like us going to come to blows? I 
wrestled on the ground with Teddy, and sometimes 
I pinched him, but a fistfight? He was just a baby, 
and even if he were older, Teddy was like half kid 
brother and half my own kid. I’d been babysitting 
him since he was a few weeks old. I could never hurt 
him like that. And Kim, an only child, didn’t have 
any siblings to sock. Maybe at camp she could’ve 
gotten into a scuffle, but the consequences would’ve 
been dire: hours-long conflict-resolution seminars 




80/256 


with the counselors and the rabbi. “My people know 
how to fight with the best of them, but with words, 
with lots and lots of words,” she told me once. 

But that fall day, we fought with fists. After the 
last bell, without a word, we followed each other out 
to the playground, dropped our backpacks on the 
ground, which was wet from the day’s steady 
drizzle. She charged me like a bull, knocking the 
wind out of me. I punched her on the side of the 
head, fist closed, like men do. A crowd of kids 
gathered around to witness the spectacle. Fighting 
was novelty enough at our school. Girl-fighting was 
extra special. And good girls going at it was like hit- 
ting the trifecta. 

By the time teachers separated us, half of the 
sixth grade was watching us (in fact, it was the ring 
of students loitering that alerted the playground 
monitors that something was up). The fight was a 
tie, I suppose. I had a split lip and a bruised wrist, 
the latter inflicted upon myself when my swing at 
Kim’s shoulder missed her and landed squarely on 
the pole of the volleyball net. Kim had a swollen eye 
and a bad scrape on her thigh as a result of her trip- 
ping over her backpack as she attempted to kick me. 




81/256 


There was no heartfelt peacemaking, no official 
detente. Once the teachers separated us, Kim and I 
looked at each other and started laughing. After fin- 
agling ourselves out of a visit to the principal’s of- 
fice, we limped home. Kim told me that the only 
reason that she volunteered for team captain was 
that if you did that at the beginning of a school year, 
coaches tended to remember and that actually kept 
them from picking you in the future (a handy trick I 
co-opted from then on). I explained to her that I ac- 
tually agreed with her take on To Kill a Mocking- 
bird, which was one of my favorite books. And then 
that was it. We were friends, just as everyone had 
assumed all along that we would be. We never laid a 
hand on each other again, and even though we’d get 
into plenty of verbal clashes, our tiffs tended to end 
the way our fistfight had, with us cracking up. 

After our big brawl, though, Mrs. Schein refused 
to let Kim come over to my house, convinced that 
her daughter would return on crutches. Mom 
offered to go over and smooth things out, but I 
think that Dad and I both realized that given her 
temper, her diplomatic mission might end up with a 
restraining order against our family. In the end, 
Dad invited the Scheins over for a roast-chicken 
dinner, and though you could see Mrs. Schein was 




82/256 


still a little weirded out by my family— “So you work 
in a record store while you study to become a teach- 
er? And you do the cooking? How unusual,” she 
said to Dad— Mr. Schein declared my parents decent 
and our family nonviolent and told Kim’s mother 
that Kim ought to be allowed to come and go freely. 

For those few months in sixth grade, Kim and I 
shed our good-girl personas. Talk about our fight 
circulated, the details growing more exagger- 
ated-broken ribs, torn-off fingernails, bite marks. 
But when we came back to school after winter 
break, it was all forgotten. We were back to being 
the dark, quiet, good-girl twins. 

We didn’t mind anymore. In fact, over the years 
that reputation has served us well. If, for instance, 
we were both absent on the same day, people auto- 
matically assumed we had come down with the 
same bug, not that we’d ditched school to watch art 
films being shown in the film-survey class at the 
university. When, as a prank, someone put our 
school up for sale, covering it with signs and posting 
a listing on eBay, suspicious eyes turned to Nelson 
Baker and Jenna McLaughlin, not to us. Even if we 
had owned up to the prank— as we’d planned to if 
anyone else got in trouble— we’d have had a hard 
time convincing anyone it really was us. 




83/256 


This always made Kim laugh. “People believe 
what they want to believe,” she said. 


4:47 P.M. 

Mom once snuck me into a casino. We were going 
on vacation to Crater Lake and we stopped at a re- 
sort on an Indian reservation for the buffet lunch. 
Mom decided to do a bit of gambling, and I went 
with her while Dad stayed with Teddy, who was 
napping in his stroller. Mom sat down at the dollar 
blackjack tables. The dealer looked at me, then at 
Mom, who returned his mildly suspicious glance 
with a look sharp enough to cut diamonds followed 
by a smile more brilliant that any gem. The dealer 
sheepishly smiled back and didn’t say a word. I 
watched Mom play, mesmerized. It seemed like we 
were in there for fifteen minutes but then Dad and 
Teddy came in search of us, both of them grumpy. It 
turned out we’d been there for over an hour. 

The ICU is like that. You can’t tell what time of 
day it is or how much time has passed. There’s no 
natural light. And there’s a constant soundtrack of 
noise, only instead of the electronic beeping of slot 




84/256 


machines and the satisfying jangle of quarters, it’s 
the hum and whir of all the medical equipment, the 
endless muffled pages over the PA, and the steady 
talk of the nurses. 

I’m not entirely sure how long I’ve been in here. A 
while ago, the nurse I liked with the lilting accent 
said she was going home. “I’ll be back tomorrow, 
but I want to see you here, sweetheart,” she said. I 
thought that was weird at first. Wouldn’t she want 
me to be home, or moved to another part of the hos- 
pital? But then I realized that she meant she wanted 
to see me in this ward, as opposed to dead. 

The doctors keep coming around and pulling up 
my eyelids and waving around a flashlight. They are 
rough and hurried, like they don’t consider eyelids 
worthy of gentleness. It makes you realize how little 
in life we touch one another’s eyes. Maybe your par- 
ents will hold an eyelid up to get out a piece of dirt, 
or maybe your boyfriend will kiss your eyelids, light 
as a butterfly, just before you drift off to sleep. But 
eyelids are not like elbows or knees or shoulders, 
parts of the body accustomed to being jostled. 

The social worker is at my bedside now. She is 
looking through my chart and talking to one of the 
nurses who normally sits at the big desk in the 




85/256 


middle of the room. It is amazing the ways they 
watch you here. If they’re not waving penlights in 
your eyes or reading the printouts that come tum- 
bling out from the bedside printers, then they are 
watching your vitals from a central computer 
screen. If anything goes slightly amiss, one of the 
monitors starts bleeping. There is always an alarm 
going off somewhere. At first, it scared me, but now 
I realize that half the time, when the alarms go off, 
it’s the machines that are malfunctioning, not the 
people. 

The social worker looks exhausted, as if she 
wouldn’t mind crawling into one of the open beds. I 
am not her only sick person. She has been shuttling 
back and forth between patients and families all af- 
ternoon. She’s the bridge between the doctors and 
the people, and you can see the strain of balancing 
between those two worlds. 

After she reads my chart and talks to the nurses, 
she goes back downstairs to my family, who have 
stopped talking in hushed tones and are now all en- 
gaged in solitary activities. Gran is knitting. Gramps 
is pretending to nap. Aunt Diane playing sudoku. 
My cousins are taking turns on a Game Boy, the 
sound turned to mute. 




86/2 5 6 


Kim has left. When she came back to the waiting 
room after visiting the chapel, she found Mrs. 
Schein a total wreck. She seemed so embarrassed 
and she hustled her mother out. Actually, I think 
having Mrs. Schein there probably helped. Comfort- 
ing her gave everyone else something to do, a way to 
feel useful. Now they’re back to feeling useless, back 
to the endless wait. 

When the social worker walks into the waiting 
room, everyone stands up, like they’re greeting roy- 
alty. She gives a half smile, which I’ve seen her do 
several times already today. I think it’s her signal 
that everything is okay, or status quo, and she’s just 
here to deliver an update, not to drop a bomb. 

“Mia is still unconscious, but her vital signs are 
improving,” she tells the assembled relatives, who 
have abandoned their distractions haphazardly on 
the chairs. “She’s in with the respiratory therapists 
right now. They’re running tests to see how her 
lungs are functioning and whether she can be 
weaned off the ventilator.” 

“That’s good news, then?” Aunt Diane asks. “I 
mean if she can breathe on her own, then she’ll 
wake up soon?” 




87/256 


The social worker gives a practiced sympathetic 
nod. “It’s a good step if she can breathe on her own. 
It shows her lungs are healing and her internal in- 
juries are stabilizing. The question mark is still the 
brain contusions.” 

“Why is that?” Cousin Heather interrupts. 

“We don’t know when she will wake up on her 
own, or the extent of the damage to her brain. These 
first twenty-four hours are the most critical and Mia 
is getting the best possible care.” 

“Can we see her?” Cramps asks. 

The social worker nods. “That’s why I’m here. I 
think it would be good for Mia to have a short visit. 
Just one or two people.” 

“We’ll go,” Gran says, stepping forward. Cramps 
is by her side. 

“Yes, that’s what I thought,” the social worker 
says. “We won’t be long,” she says to the rest of the 
family. 

The three of them walk down the hall in silence. 
In the elevator, the social worker attempts to pre- 
pare my grandparents for the sight of me, explain- 
ing the extent of my external injuries, which look 




88/2 5 6 


bad, but are treatable. It’s the internal injuries that 
they’re worried about, she says. 

She’s acting like my grandparents are children. 
But they’re tougher than they look. Gramps was a 
medic in Korea. And Gran, she’s always rescuing 
things: birds with broken wings, a sick beaver, a 
deer hit by a car. The deer went to a wildlife sanctu- 
ary, which is funny because Gran usually hates deer; 
they eat up her garden. “Pretty rats,” she calls them. 
“Tasty rats” is what Gramps calls them when he 
grills up venison steaks. But that one deer, Gran 
couldn’t bear to see it suffer, so she rescued it. Part 
of me suspects she thought it was one of her angels. 

Still, when they come through the automatic 
double doors into the ICU, both of them stop, as if 
repelled by an invisible barrier. Gran takes 
Gramps’s hand, and I try to remember if I’ve ever 
seen them hold hands before. Gran scans the beds 
for me, but just as the social worker starts to point 
out where I am, Gramps sees me and he strides 
across the floor to my bed. 

“Hello, duck,” he says. He hasn’t called me that in 
ages, not since I was younger than Teddy. Gran 
walks slowly to where I am, taking little gulps of air 




89/256 


as she comes. Maybe those wounded animals wer- 
en’t such good prep after all. 

The social worker pulls over two chairs, setting 
them up at the foot of my bed. “Mia, your grandpar- 
ents are here.” She motions for them to sit down. 
“I’ll leave you alone now.” 

“Can she hear us?” Gran asks. “If we talk to her, 
she’ll understand?” 

“Truly, I don’t know,” the social worker responds. 
“But your presence can be soothing so long as what 
you say is soothing.” Then she gives them a stern 
look, as if to tell them not to say anything bad to up- 
set me. I know it’s her job to warn them about 
things like this and that she is busy with a thousand 
things and can’t always be so sensitive, but for a 
second, I hate her. 

After the social worker leaves, Gran and Gramps 
sit in silence for a minute. Then Gran starts prat- 
tling on about the orchids she’s growing in her 
greenhouse. I notice that she’s changed out of her 
gardening smock into a clean pair of corduroy pants 
and a sweater. Someone must have stopped by her 
house to bring her fresh clothes. Gramps is sitting 
very still, and his hands are shaking. He’s not much 




90/256 


of a talker, so it must be hard for him being ordered 
to chat with me now. 

Another nurse comes by. She has dark hair and 
dark eyes brightened with lots of shimmery eye 
makeup. Her nails are acrylic and have heart decals 
on them. She must have to work hard to keep her 
nails so pretty. I admire that. 

She’s not my nurse but she comes up to Gran and 
Gramps just the same. “Don’t you doubt for a 
second that she can hear you,” she tells them. “She’s 
aware of everything that’s going on.” She stands 
there with her hands on her hips. I can almost pic- 
ture her snapping gum. Gran and Gramps stare at 
her, lapping up what she’s telling them. “You might 
think that the doctors or nurses or all this is run- 
ning the show,” she says, gesturing to the wall of 
medical equipment. “Nuh-uh. She’s running the 
show. Maybe she’s just biding her time. So you talk 
to her. You tell her to take all the time she needs, 
but to come on back. You’re waiting for her.” 


Mom and Dad would never call Teddy or me mis- 
takes. Or accidents. Or surprises. Or any of those 


91/256 


other stupid euphemisms. But neither one of us was 
planned, and they never tried to hide that. 

Mom got pregnant with me when she was young. 
Not teenager-young, but young for their set of 
friends. She was twenty-three and she and Dad had 
already been married for a year. 

In a funny way, Dad was always a bow-tie wearer, 
always a little more traditional than you might ima- 
gine. Because even though he had blue hair and tat- 
toos and wore leather jackets and worked in a re- 
cord store, he wanted to marry Mom back at a time 
when the rest of their friends were still having 
drunken one-night stands. “Girlfriend is such a stu- 
pid word,” he said. “I couldn’t stand calling her that. 
So, we had to get married, so I could call her ‘wife.’” 

Mom, for her part, had a messed-up family. She 
didn’t go into the gory details with me, but I knew 
her father was long gone and for a while she had 
been out of touch with her mother, though now we 
saw Grandma and Papa Richard, which is what we 
called Mom’s stepfather, a couple times a year. 

So Mom was taken not just with Dad but with the 
big, mostly intact, relatively normal family he be- 
longed to. She agreed to marry Dad even though 
they’d been together just a year. Of course, they still 




92/256 


did it their way. They were married by a lesbian 
justice of the peace while their friends played a 
guitar-feedback-heavy version of the “Wedding 
March.” The bride wore a white-fringed flapper 
dress and black spiked boots. The groom wore 
leather. 


They got pregnant with me because of someone 
else’s wedding. One of Dad’s music buddies who’d 
moved to Seattle had gotten his girlfriend pregnant, 
so they were doing the shotgun thing. Mom and 
Dad went to the wedding, and at the reception, they 
got a little drunk and back at the hotel weren’t as 
careful as usual. Three months later there was a thin 
blue line on the pregnancy test. 

The way they tell it, neither felt particularly ready 
to be parents. Neither one felt like an adult yet. But 
there was no question that they would have me. 
Mom was adamantly pro-choice. She had a bumper 
sticker on the car that read If you can’t trust me 
with a choice, how can you trust me with a child? 
But in her case the choice was to keep me. 

Dad was more hesitant. More freaked out. Until 
the minute the doctor pulled me out and then he 
started to cry. 




93/256 


“That’s poppycock,” he would say when Mom re- 
counted the story. “I did no such thing.” 

“You didn’t cry then?” Mom asked in sarcastic 
amusement. 

“I teared. I did not cry.” Then Dad winked at me 
and pantomimed weeping like a baby. 

Because I was the only kid in Mom and Dad’s 
group of friends, I was a novelty. I was raised by the 
music community, with dozens of aunties and 
uncles who took me in as their own little foundling, 
even after I started showing a strange preference for 
classical music. I didn’t want for real family, either. 
Gran and Gramps lived nearby, and they were 
happy to take me for weekends so Mom and Dad 
could act wild and stay out all night for one of Dad’s 
shows. 

Around the time I was four, I think my parents 
realized that they were actually doing it— raising a 
kid— even though they didn’t have a ton of money or 
“real” jobs. We had a nice house with cheap rent. I 
had clothes (even if they were hand-me-downs from 
my cousins) and I was growing up happy and 
healthy. “You were like an experiment,” Dad said. 
“Surprisingly successful. We thought it must be a 




94/256 


fluke. We needed another kid as a kind of control 
group.” 

They tried for four years. Mom got pregnant twice 
and had two miscarriages. They were sad about it, 
but they didn’t have the money to do all the fertility 
stuff that people do. By the time I was nine, they’d 
decided that maybe it was for the best. I was becom- 
ing independent. They stopped trying. 

As if to convince themselves how great it was not 
to be tied down by a baby, Mom and Dad bought us 
tickets to go visit New York for a week. It was sup- 
posed to be a musical pilgrimage. We would go to 
CBGB’s and Carnegie Hall. But when to her sur- 
prise, Mom discovered she was pregnant, and then 
to her greater surprise, stayed pregnant past the 
first trimester, we had to cancel the trip. She was 
tired and sick to her stomach and so grumpy Dad 
joked that she’d probably scare the New Yorkers. 
Besides, babies were expensive and we needed to 
save. 

I didn’t mind. I was excited about a baby. And I 
knew that Carnegie Hall wasn’t going anywhere. I’d 
get there someday. 




5:40 P.M. 


95/256 


I am a little freaked out right now. Gran and 
Gramps left a while ago, but I stayed behind here in 
the ICU. I am sitting in one the chairs, going over 
their conversation, which was very nice and normal 
and nondisturbing. Until they left. As Gran and 
Gramps walked out of the ICU, with me following, 
Gramps turned to Gran and asked: “Do you think 
she decides?” 

“Decides what?” 

Gramps looked uncomfortable. He shuffled his 
feet. “You know? Decides,” he whispered. 

“What are you talking about?” Gran sounded ex- 
asperated and tender at the same time. 

“I don’t know what I’m talking about. You’re the 
one who believes in all the angels.” 

“What does that have to do with Mia?” Gran 
asked. 

“If they’re gone now, but still here, like you be- 
lieve, what if they want her to join them? What if 
she wants to join them?” 

“It doesn’t work like that,” Gran snapped. 




96/256 


“Oh,” was all Gramps said. The inquiry was over. 

After they left, I was thinking that one day maybe 
I’ll tell Gran that I never much bought into her the- 
ory that birds and such could be people’s guardian 
angels. And now I’m more sure than ever that 
there’s no such thing. 

My parents aren’t here. They are not holding my 
hand, or cheering me on. I know them well enough 
to know that if they could, they would. Maybe not 
both of them. Maybe Mom would stay with Teddy 
while Dad watched over me. But neither of them is 
here. 

And it’s while contemplating this that I think 
about what the nurse said. She’s running the show. 
And suddenly I understand what Gramps was really 
asking Gran. He had listened to that nurse, too. He 
got it before I did. 

If I stay. If I live. It’s up to me. 

All this business about medically induced comas 
is just doctor talk. It’s not up to the doctors. It’s not 
up to the absentee angels. It’s not even up to God 
who, if He exists, is nowhere around right now. It’s 
up to me. 




97/256 


How am I supposed to decide this? How can I 
possibly stay without Mom and Dad? How can I 
leave without Teddy? Or Adam? This is too much. I 
don’t even understand how it all works, why I’m 
here in the state that I’m in or how to get out of it if 
I wanted to. If I were to say, I want to wake up, 
would I wake up right now? I already tried snapping 
my heels to find Teddy and trying to beam myself to 
Hawaii, and that didn’t work. This seems a whole lot 
more complicated. 

But in spite of that, I believe it’s true. I hear the 
nurse’s words again. I am running the show. Every- 
one is waiting on me. 

I decide. I know this now. 

And this terrifies me more than anything else that 
has happened today. 

Where the hell is Adam? 


A week before Halloween of my junior year, Adam 
showed up at my door triumphant. He was holding 
a dress bag and wearing a shit-eating grin. 




98/256 


“Prepare to writhe in jealousy. I just got the best 
costume,” he said. He unzipped the bag. Inside was 
a frilly white shirt, a pair of breeches, and a long 
wool coat with epaulets. 

“You’re going to be Seinfeld with the puffy shirt?” 
I asked. 

“Pff. Seinfeld. And you call yourself a classical 
musician. I’m going to be Mozart. Wait, you haven’t 
seen the shoes.” He reached into the bag and pulled 
out clunky black leather numbers with metal bars 
across the tops. 

“Nice,” I said. “I think my mom has a pair like 
them.” 

“You’re just jealous because you don’t have such a 
rockin’ costume. And I’ll be wearing tights, too. I’m 
just that secure in my manhood. Also, I have a wig.” 

“Where’d you get all this?” I asked, fingering the 
wig. It felt like it was made of burlap. 

“Online. Only a hundred bucks.” 

“You spent a hundred dollars on a Halloween 
costume?” 

At the mention of the world Halloween, Teddy 
zoomed down the stairs, ignoring me and yanking 




99/256 


on Adam’s wallet chain. “Wait here!” he demanded, 
and then ran back upstairs and returned a few 
seconds later holding a bag. “Is this a good cos- 
tume? Or will it make me look babyish?” Teddy 
asked, pulling out a pitchfork, a set of devil ears, a 
red tail, and a pair of red feetie pajamas. 

“Ohh.” Adam stepped backward, his eyes wide. 
“That outfit scares the hell out of me and you aren’t 
even wearing it.” 

“Really? You don’t think the pajamas make it look 
dumb. I don’t want anyone to laugh at me,” Teddy 
declared, his eyebrows furrowed in seriousness. 

I grinned at Adam, who was trying to swallow his 
own smile. “Red pajamas plus pitchfork plus devil 
ears and pointy tail is so fully satanic no one would 
dare challenge you, lest they risk eternal damna- 
tion,” Adam assured him. 

Teddy’s face broke into a wide grin, showing off 
the gap of his missing front tooth. “That’s kind of 
what Mom said, but I just wanted to make sure she 
wasn’t just telling me that so I wouldn’t bug her 
about the costume. You’re taking me trick-or-treat- 
ing, right?” He looked at me now. 




100/256 


“Just like every year,” I answered. “How else am I 
gonna get candy?” 

“You’re coming, too?” he asked Adam. 

“I wouldn’t miss it.” 

Teddy turned on his heel and whizzed back up the 
stairs. Adam turned to me. “That’s Teddy settled. 
What are you wearing?” 

“Ahh, I’m not much of a costume girl.” 

Adam rolled his eyes. “Well, become one. It’s Hal- 
loween, our first one together. Shooting Star has a 
big show that night. It’s a costume concert, and you 
promised to go.” 

Inwardly, I groaned. After six months with Adam, 
I had just gotten used to us being the odd couple at 
school— people called us Groovy and the Geek. And 
I was starting to become more comfortable with 
Adam’s bandmates, and had even learned a few 
words of rock talk. I could hold my own now when 
Adam took me to the House of Rock, the rambling 
house near the college where the rest of the band all 
lived. I could even participate in the band’s punk- 
rock pot-luck parties when everyone invited had to 
bring something from their fridge that was on the 
verge of spoiling. We took all the ingredients and 




101/256 


made something out of it. I was actually pretty good 
at finding ways to turn the vegetarian ground beef, 
beets, feta cheese, and apricots into something 
edible. 

But I still hated the shows and hated myself for 
hating them. The clubs were smoky, which hurt my 
eyes and made my clothes stink. The speakers were 
always turned up so high that the music blared, 
causing my ears ring so loudly afterward that the 
high-pitched drone would actually keep me up. I’d 
lie in bed, replaying the awkward night and feeling 
shittier about it with each playback. 

“Don’t tell me you’re gonna back out,” Adam said, 
looking equal parts hurt and irritated. 

“What about Teddy? We promised we’d take him 
trick-or-treating—” 

“Yeah, at five o’clock. We don’t have to be at the 
show until ten. I doubt even Master Ted could trick- 
or-treat for five solid hours. So you have no excuse. 
And you’d better get a good outfit together because 
I’m going to look hot, in an eighteenth-century kind 
of way.” 

After Adam left to go to work delivering pizzas, I 
had a pit in my stomach. I went upstairs to practice 




102/256 


the Dvorak piece Professor Christie had assigned 
me, and to work out what was bothering me. Why 
didn’t I like his shows? Was it because Shooting 
Star was getting popular and I was jealous? Did the 
ever-growing masses of girl groupies put me off? 
This seemed like a logical enough explanation, but it 
wasn’t it. 

After I’d played for about ten minutes, it came to 
me: My aversion to Adam’s shows had nothing to do 
with music or groupies or envy. It had to with the 
doubts. The same niggling doubts I always had 
about not belonging. I didn’t feel like I belonged 
with my family, and now I didn’t feel like I belonged 
with Adam, except unlike my family, who was stuck 
with me, Adam had chosen me, and this I didn’t un- 
derstand. Why had he fallen for me? It didn’t make 
sense. I knew it was music that brought us together 
in the first place, put us in the same space so we 
could even get to know each other. And I knew that 
Adam liked how into music I was. And that he dug 
my sense of humor, “so dark you almost miss it,” he 
said. And, speaking of dark, I knew he had a thing 
for dark-haired girls because all of his girlfriends 
had been brunettes. And I knew that when it was 
the two of us alone together, we could talk for 
hours, or sit reading side by side for hours, each one 




103/256 


plugged into our own iPod, and still feel completely 
together. I understood all that in my head, but I still 
didn’t believe it in my heart. When I was with 
Adam, I felt picked, chosen, special, and that just 
made me wonder why me? even more. 

And maybe this was why even though Adam will- 
ingly submitted to Schubert symphonies and atten- 
ded any recital I gave, bringing me stargazer lilies, 
my favorite flower, I’d still rather have gone to the 
dentist than to one of his shows. Which was so 
churlish of me. I thought of what Mom sometimes 
said to me when I was feeling insecure: “Fake it till 
you make it.” By the time I finished playing the 
piece three times over, I decided that not only 
would I go to his show, but for once I’d make as 
much of an effort to understand his world as he did 
mine. 


“I need your help,” I told Mom that night after din- 
ner as we stood side by side doing dishes. 

“I think we’ve established that I’m not very good 
at trigonometry. Maybe you can try the online-tutor 
thing,” Mom said. 

“Not math help. Something else.” 




104/256 


“I’ll do my best. What do you need?’ 

“Advice. Who’s the coolest, toughest, hottest 
rocker girl you can think of?” 

“Debbie Harry,” Mom said. 

“Tha-” 

“Not finished,” Mom interrupted. “You can’t ask 
me to pick only one. That’s so Sophie’s Choice. 
Kathleen Hannah. Patti Smith. Joan Jett. Courtney 
Love, in her demented destructionist way. Lucinda 
Williams, even though she’s country she’s tough as 
nails. Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth, pushing fifty 
and still at it. That Cat Power woman. Joan Armat- 
rading. Why, is this some kind of social-studies 
project?” 

“Kind of,” I answered, toweling off a chipped 
plate. “It’s for Halloween.” 

Mom clapped her soapy hands together in de- 
light. “You planning on impersonating one of us?” 

“Yeah,” I replied. “Can you help me?” 

Mom took off work early so we could trawl 
through vintage-clothing stores. She decided we 
should go for a pastiche of rocker looks, rather than 
trying to copy any one artist. We bought a pair of 




105/256 


tight, lizard-skin pants. A blond bobbed wig with 
severe bangs, a la early-eighties Debbie Harry, 
which Mom streaked with purple Manic Panic. For 
accessories, we got a black leather band for one 
wrist and about two dozen silver bangles for the 
other. Mom fished out a her own vintage Sonic 
Youth T-shirt— warning me not to take it off lest 
someone grab it and sell it on eBay for a couple 
hundred bucks— and the pair of black, pointy-toed 
leather spiked boots that she’d worn to her 
wedding. 


On Halloween, she did my makeup, thick streaks of 
black liquid eyeliner that made my eyes look dan- 
gerous. White powder that made my skin pale. 
Bloodred gashes on my lips. A stick-on nose ring. 
When I looked in the mirror, I saw Mom’s face peer- 
ing back at me. Maybe it was the blond wig, but this 
was the first time I ever thought I actually looked 
like any of my immediate family. 

My parents and Teddy waited downstairs for 
Adam while I stayed in my room. It felt like this was 
prom or something. Dad held the camera. Mom was 
practically dancing with excitement. When Adam 




106/256 


came through door, showering Teddy with Skittles, 
Mom and Dad called me down. 

I did a slinky walk as best as I could in the heels. 
I’d expected Adam to go crazy when he saw me, his 
jeans-and-sweaters girlfriend all glammed out. But 
he smiled his usual greeting, chuckling a bit. “Nice 
costume,” was all he said. 

“Quid pro quo. Only fair,” I said, pointing to his 
Mozart ensemble. 

“I think you look scary, but pretty,” Teddy said. 
“I’d say sexy, too, but I’m your brother, so that’s 
gross.” 

“How do you even know what sexy means?” I 
asked. “You’re six.” 

“Everyone knows what sexy means,” he said. 

Everyone but me, I guess. But that night, I kind of 
learned. When we trick-or-treated with Teddy, my 
own neighbors who’d known me for years didn’t re- 
cognize me. Guys who’d never given me a second 
glance did a double take. And every time that 
happened, I felt a little bit more like the risky sexy 
chick I was pretending to be. Fake it till you make it 
actually worked. 




107/256 


The club where Shooting Star was playing was 
packed. Everyone was in costume, most of the girls 
in the kinds of racy getups— cleavage-baring French 
maids, whip-wielding dominatrixes, slutty Wizard 
of Oz Dorothys with skirts hiked up to show their 
ruby garters— that normally made me feel like a big 
oaf. I didn’t feel oafish at all that night, even if 
nobody seemed to recognize that I was wearing a 
costume. 

“You were supposed to dress up,” a skeleton guy 
chastised me before offering me a beer. 

“I fucking LOVE those pants,” a flapper girl 
screamed into my ear. “Did you get them in 
Seattle?” 

“Aren’t you in the Crack House Quartet?” a guy in 
a Hillary Clinton mask asked me, referring to some 
hard-core band that Adam loved and I hated. 

When Shooting Star went on, I didn’t stay back- 
stage, which is what I normally did. Backstage I 
could sit on a chair and have an uninterrupted view 
and not have to talk to anybody. This time, I 
lingered out by the bar, and then, when the flapper 
girl grabbed me, I joined her dancing in the mosh 
pit. 




108/256 


I’d never gone into the mosh pit before. I had 
little interest in running around in circles while 
drunk, brawny boys in leather trod on my toes. But 
tonight, I totally got into it. I understood what it 
was like to merge your energy with the mob’s and to 
absorb theirs as well. How in the pit, when things 
got going, you weren’t so much walking or dancing 
as being sucked into a whirlpool. 

When Adam finished his set, I was as panting and 
sweaty as he was. I didn’t go backstage to greet him 
before everyone else got to him. I waited for him to 
go to the floor of the club, to meet his public like he 
did at the end of every show. And when he came 
out, a towel around his neck, sucking on a bottle of 
water, I flung myself into his arms and kissed him 
openmouthed and sloppy in front of everyone. I 
could feel him smiling as he kissed me back. 

“Well, well, looks like someone has been infused 
with spirit of Debbie Harry,” he said, wiping some 
of the lipstick off his chin. 

“I guess so. What about you? Are you feeling very 
Mozarty?” 

“All I know about him is from what I saw in that 
movie. But I remember he was kind of a horndog, so 




109/256 


after that kiss, I guess I am. You ready to go? I can 
load up and we can get out of here.” 

“No, let’s stay for the last set.” 

“Really?" Adam asked, his eyebrows rising in 
surprise. 

“Yeah. I might even go into the pit with you.” 

“Have you been drinking?” he teased. 

“Just the Kool-Aid,” I replied. 

We danced, stopping every now and again to 
make out, until the club closed. 


On the way home, Adam held my hand while he 
drove. Every so often he’d turn to look at me and 
smile while shaking his head. 

“So you like me like this?” I asked. 

“Hmm,” he responded. 

“Is that a yes or a no?” 

“Of course I like you.” 

“No, like this. Did you like me tonight?” 

Adam straightened up. “I liked that you got into 
the show and weren’t chomping to leave ASAP. And 




110/256 


I loved dancing with you. And I loved how comfort- 
able you seemed to be with all us riffraff.” 

“But did you like me like this? Like me better?” 

“Than what?” he asked. He looked genuinely 
perplexed. 

“Than normal.” I was getting irritated now. I’d 
felt so brazen tonight, like the Halloween costume 
had imbued me with a new personality, one more 
worthy of Adam, of my family. I tried to explain that 
to him, and to my dismay, found myself near tears. 

Adam seemed to sense that I was upset. He pulled 
the car off onto a logging road and turned to me. 
“Mia, Mia, Mia,” he said, stroking the tendrils of my 
hair that had escaped from the wig. “This is the you 
I like. You definitely dressed sexier and are, you 
know, blond, and that’s different. But the you who 
you are tonight is the same you I was in love with 
yesterday, the same you I’ll be in love with tomor- 
row. I love that you’re fragile and tough, quiet and 
kick-ass. Hell, you’re one of the punkest girls I 
know, no matter who you listen to or what you 
wear.” 

After that, whenever I started to doubt Adam’s 
feelings, I’d think about my wig, gathering dust in 




111/256 


my closet, and it would bring back the memory of 
that night. And then I wouldn’t feel insecure. I’d just 
feel lucky. 


7:13 P.M. 


He’s here. 

I have been hanging out in an empty hospital 
room in the maternity ward, wanting to be far away 
from my relatives and even farther away from the 
ICU and that nurse, or more specifically what that 
nurse said and what I now understand. I needed to 
be somewhere where people wouldn’t be sad, where 
the thoughts concerned life, not death. So I came 
here, the land of screaming babies. Actually, the 
wail of the newborns is comforting. They have so 
much fight in them already. 

But it’s quiet in this room now. So I’m sitting on 
the windowsill, staring out at the night. A car 
screeches into the parking garage, shaking me out of 
my reverie. I peer down in time to catch a glimpse of 




112/256 


the taillights of a pink car disappear into the dark- 
ness. Sarah, who is the girlfriend of Liz, Shooting 
Star’s drummer, has a pink Dodge Dart. I hold my 
breath, waiting for Adam to appear out of the tun- 
nel. And then he’s here, walking up the ramp, hug- 
ging his leather jacket against the winter night. I can 
see the chain of his wallet glinting in the floodlights. 
He stops, turns around to talk to someone behind 
him. I see the soft figure of a woman emerge from 
the shadows. At first, I think it must be Liz. But then 
I see the braid. 

I wish I could hug her. To thank her for always 
being one step ahead of what I need. 

Of course Kim would go to Adam, to tell him in 
person as opposed to breaking the news over the 
phone, and then to bring him here, to me. It was 
Kim who knew that Adam was playing a show in 
Portland. Kim who must have somehow managed to 
cajole her mother into driving downtown. Kim who, 
judging by Mrs. Schein’s absence, must have con- 
vinced her mother to go home, to let her stay with 
Adam and me. I remember how it took Kim two 
months to get permission to take that helicopter 
flight with her uncle, so I’m impressed that she 
managed this amount of emancipation within the 
space of a few hours. It was Kim who must have 




113/256 


braved any number of intimidating bouncers and 
hipsters to find Adam. And Kim who must have 
braved telling Adam. 

I know this sounds ridiculous, but I’m glad it 
wasn’t me. I don’t think I could have borne it. Kim 
had to bear it. 

And now, because of her, he is finally here. 

All day long, I’ve been imagining Adam’s arrival, 
and in my fantasy, I rush to greet him, even though 
he can’t see me and even though, from what I can 
tell so far, it’s nothing like that movie Ghost, where 
you can walk through your loved ones so that they 
feel your presence. 

But now that Adam is here, I’m paralyzed. I’m 
scared to see him. To see his face. I’ve seen Adam 
cry twice. Once when we watched It’s a Wonderful 
Life. And another time when we were in the train 
station in Seattle and we saw a mother yelling and 
swatting her son who had Down syndrome. He just 
got quiet and it was only when we were walking 
away that I saw the tears rolling down his cheeks. 
And it damn near tore my heart out. If he is crying, 
it will kill me. Forget this my choice business. That 
alone will do me in. 




114/256 

I’m such a chickenshit. 

I look at the clock on the wall. It’s past seven now. 
Shooting Star will not be opening for Bikini after all. 
Which is a shame. It was a huge break for them. For 
a second, I wonder if the rest of the band will go on 
without Adam. I highly doubt it, though. It’s not just 
that he is the lead singer and the lead guitar player. 

The band has this kind of code. Loyalty to feelings is 
important. Last summer, when Liz and Sarah broke 
up (for what turned out to be all of a month) and Liz 
was too distraught to play, they canceled their five- 
night tour, even though this guy Gordon who plays 
drums in another band offered to sub for her. 

I watch Adam make his way to the hospital’s main 
entrance, Kim trailing behind him. Just before he 
comes to the covered awning and the automatic 
doors, he looks up into the sky. He is waiting for 
Kim but I also like to think he’s looking for me. His 
face, illuminated by the lights, is blank, like 
someone vacuumed away all his personality, leaving 
only a mask. He doesn’t look like him. But at least 
he’s not crying. 

That gives me the guts to go to him now. Or 
rather to me, to the ICU, which is where I know he 
will want to go. Adam knows Gran and Gramps and 




115/256 


the cousins, and I imagine he’ll join the waiting- 
room vigil later. But right now he’s here for me. 


Back in the ICU time stands still as always. One of 
the surgeons who worked on me earlier— the one 
who sweated a lot and, when it was his turn to pick 
the music, blasted Weezer— is checking in on me. 

The light is dim and artificial and kept to the 
same level all the time, but even so, the circadian 
rhythms win out and a nighttime hush has fallen 
over the place. It is less frenetic than it was during 
the day, like the nurses and machines are all a little 
tired and have reverted to power-save mode. 

So when Adam’s voice reverberates from the hall- 
way outside the ICU, it really wakes everyone up. 

“What do you mean I can’t go in?” he booms. 

I make my way across the ICU, standing just on 
the other side of the automatic doors. I hear the or- 
derly outside explain to Adam that he is not allowed 
in this part of the hospital. 

“This is bullshit!” Adam yells. 

Inside the ward, all the nurses look toward the 
door, their heavy eyes wary. I am pretty sure they’re 




116/256 


thinking: Don’t we have enough to deal with inside 
without having to calm down crazy people outside? 
I want explain to them that Adam isn’t crazy. That 
he never yells, except for very special occasions. 

The graying middle-aged nurse who doesn’t at- 
tend to the patients but sits by and monitors the 
computers and phones, gives a little nod and stands 
up as if accepting a nomination. She straightens her 
creased white pants and makes her way toward the 
door. She’s really not the best one to talk to him. I 
wish I could warn them that they ought to send 
Nurse Ramirez, the one who reassured my grand- 
parents (and freaked me out). She’d be able to calm 
him down. But this one is only going to make it 
worse. I follow her through the double doors where 
Adam and Kim are arguing with an orderly. The or- 
derly looks at the nurse. “I told them they’re not au- 
thorized to be up here,” he explains. The nurse dis- 
misses him with the wave of a hand. 

“Can I help you, young man?” she asks Adam. 
Her voice sounds irritated and impatient, like some 
of Dad’s tenured colleagues at school who Dad says 
are just counting the days till retirement. 

Adam clears his throat, attempting to pull himself 
together. “I’d like to visit a patient,” he says, 




117/256 


gesturing toward the doors blocking him from the 
ICU. 

“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” she replies. 

“But my girlfriend, Mia, she’s—” 

“She’s being well cared for,” the nurse interrupts. 
She sounds tired, too tired for sympathy, too tired 
to be moved by young love. 

“I understand that. And I’m grateful for it,” Adam 
says. He’s trying his best to play by her rules, to 
sound mature, but I hear the catch in his voice when 
he says: “I really need to see her.” 

“I’m sorry, young man, but visitations are restric- 
ted to immediate family.” 

I hear Adam gasp. Immediate family . The nurse 
doesn’t mean to be cruel. She’s just clueless, but 
Adam won’t know that. I feel the need to protect 
him and to protect the nurse from what he might do 
to her. I reach for him, on instinct, even though I 
cannot really touch him. But his back is to me now. 
His shoulders are hunched over, his legs starting to 
buckle. 

Kim, who was hovering near the wall, is suddenly 
at his side, her arms encircling his falling form. 
With both arms locked around his waist, she turns 




118/256 


to the nurse, her eyes blazing with fury. “You don’t 
understand!” she cries. 

“Do I need to call security?” the nurse asks. 

Adam waves his hand, surrendering to the nurse, 
to Kim. “Don’t ,” he whispers to Kim. 

So Kim doesn’t. Without saying another word, 
she hoists his arm around her shoulder and shifts 
his weight onto her. Adam has about a foot and fifty 
pounds on Kim, but after stumbling for a second, 
she adjusts to the added burden. She bears it. 


Kim and I have this theory that almost everything in 
the world can be divided into two groups. 

There are people who like classical music. People 
who like pop. There are city people. And country 
people. Coke drinkers. Pepsi drinkers. There are 
conformists and free-thinkers. Virgins and nonvir- 
gins. And there are the kind of girls who have boy- 
friends in high school, and the kind of girls who 
don’t. 


119/256 


Kim and I had always assumed that we both be- 
longed to the latter category. “Not that we’ll be 
forty-year-old virgins or anything,” she reassured. 
“We’ll just be the kinds of girls who have boyfriends 
in college.” 

That always made sense to me, seemed preferable 
even. Mom was the sort of girl who had had boy- 
friends in high school and often remarked that she 
wished she hadn’t wasted her time. “There’s only so 
many times a girl wants to get drunk on Mickey’s 
Big Mouth, go cow-tipping, and make out in back of 
a pickup truck. As far as the boys I dated were con- 
cerned, that amounted to a romantic evening.” 

Dad on the other hand, didn’t really date till col- 
lege. He was shy in high school, but then he started 
playing drums and freshman year of college joined a 
punk band, and boom, girlfriends. Or at least a few 
of them until he met Mom, and boom, a wife. I kind 
of figured it would go that way for me. 

So, it was a surprise to both Kim and me when I 
wound up in Group A, with the boyfriended girls. At 
first, I tried to hide it. After I came home from the 
Yo-Yo Ma concert, I told Kim the vaguest of det a ils. 
I didn’t mention the kissing. I rationalized the omis- 
sion: There was no point getting all worked up 




120/256 


about a kiss. One kiss does not a relationship make. 
I’d kissed boys before, and usually by the next day 
the kiss had evaporated like a dewdrop in the sun. 

Except I knew that with Adam it was a big deal. I 
knew from the way the warmth flooded my whole 
body that night after he dropped me off at home, 
kissing me once more at my doorstep. By the way I 
stayed up until dawn hugging my pillow. By the way 
that I could not eat the next day, could not wipe the 
smile off my face. I recognized that the kiss was a 
door I had walked through. And I knew that I’d left 
Kim on the other side. 

After a week, and a few more stolen kisses, I knew 
I had to tell Kim. We went for coffee after school. It 
was May but it was pouring rain as though it were 
November. I felt slightly suffocated by what I had to 
do. 

“I’ll buy. You want one of your froufrou drinks?” I 
asked. That was another one of the categories we’d 
determined: people who drank plain coffee and 
people who drank gussied-up caffeine drinks like 
the mint-chip lattes Kim was so fond of. 

“I think I’ll try the cinnamon-spice chai latte,” she 
said, giving me a stern look that said, I will not be 
ashamed of my beverage selection. 




121/256 


I bought us our drinks and a piece of marionberry 
pie with two forks. I sat down across from Kim, run- 
ning the fork along the scalloped edge of the flaky 
crust. 

“I have something to tell you,” I said. 

“Something about having a boyfriend?” Kim’s 
voice was amused, but even though I was looking 
down, I could tell that she’d rolled her eyes. 

“How’d you know?” I asked, meeting her gaze. 

She rolled her eyes again. “Please. Everyone 
knows. It’s the hottest gossip this side of Melanie 
Farrow dropping out to have a baby. It’s like a 
Democratic presidential candidate marrying a Re- 
publican presidential candidate.” 

“Who said anything about marrying?” 

“I’m just being metaphoric,” Kim said. “Anyhow, I 
know. I knew even before you knew.” 

“Bullshit.” 

“Come on. A guy like Adam going to a Yo-Yo Ma 
concert? He was buttering you up.” 

“It’s not like that,” I said, though of course, it was 
totally like that. 




122/256 


“I just don’t see why you couldn’t tell me sooner,” 
she said in a quiet voice. 

I was about to give her my whole one-kiss-not- 
equaling-a-relationship spiel and to explain that I 
didn’t want to blow it out of proportion, but I 
stopped myself. “I was afraid you’d be mad at me,” I 
admitted. 

“I’m not,” Kim said. “But I will be if you ever lie to 
me again.” 

“Okay,” I said. 

“Or if you turn into one of those girlfriends, al- 
ways ponying around after her boyfriend, and 
speaking in the first-person plural. ‘We love the 
winter. We think Velvet Underground is seminal.’” 

“You know I wouldn’t rock-talk to you. First-per- 
son singular or plural. I promise.” 

“Good,” Kim replied. “Because if you turn into 
one of those girls, I’ll shoot you.” 

“If I turn into one of those girls, I’ll hand you the 
gun.” 

Kim laughed for real at that, and the tension was 
broken. She popped a hunk of pie into her mouth. 
“How did your parents take it?” 




123/256 


“Dad went through the five phases of griev- 
ing— denial, anger, acceptance, whatever— in like 
one day. I think he’s more freaked out that he is old 
enough to have a daughter who has a boyfriend.” I 
paused, took a sip of my coffee, letting the word 
boyfriend rest out in the air. “And he claims he can’t 
believe that I’m dating a musician.” 

“You’re a musician,” Kim reminded me. 

“You know, a punk, pop musician.” 

“Shooting Star is emo-core,” Kim corrected. Un- 
like me, she cared about the myriad pop musical 
distinctions: punk, indie, alternative, hard-core, 
emo-core. 

“It’s mostly hot air, you know, part of his whole 
bow-tie-Dad thing. I think Dad likes Adam. He met 
him when he picked me up for the concert. Now he 
wants me to bring him over for dinner, but it’s only 
been a week. I’m not quite ready for a meet-the- 
folks moment yet.” 

“I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for that.” Kim 
shuddered at the thought of it. “What about your 
mom?” 

“She offered to take me to Planned Parenthood to 
get the Pill and told me to make Adam get tested for 




124/256 


various diseases. In the meantime, she ordered me 
to buy condoms now. She even gave me ten bucks to 
start my supply.” 

“Have you?” Kim gasped. 

“No, it’s only been a week,” I said. “We’re still in 
the same group on that one.” 

“For now,” Kim said. 

One other category that Kim and I devised was 
people who tried to be cool and people who did not. 
On this one, I thought that Adam, Kim, and I were 
in the same column, because even though Adam 
was cool, he didn’t try. It was effortless for him. So, 
I expected the three of us to become the best of 
friends. I expected Adam to love everyone I loved as 
much as I did. 

And it did work out like that with my family. He 
practically became the third kid. But it never clicked 
with Kim. Adam treated her the way that I’d always 
imagined he would treat a girl like me. He was nice 
enough— polite, friendly, but distant. He didn’t at- 
tempt to enter her world or gain her confidence. I 
suspected he thought she wasn’t cool enough and it 




125/256 


made me mad. After we’d been together about three 
months, we had a huge fight about it. 

“I’m not dating Kim. I’m dating you,” he said, 
after I accused him of not being nice enough to her. 

“So what? You have lots of female friends. Why 
not add her to the stable?” 

Adam shrugged. “I don’t know. It’s just not 
there.” 

“You’re such a snob!” I said, suddenly furious. 

Adam eyed me with furrowed brows, like I was a 
math problem on the blackboard that he was trying 
to figure out. “How does that make me a snob? You 
can’t force friendship. We just don’t have a lot in 
common.” 

“That’s what makes you a snob! You only like 
people like you,” I cried. I stormed out, expecting 
him to follow after me, begging forgiveness, and 
when he didn’t, my fury doubled. I rode my bike 
over to Kim’s house to vent. She listened to my 
diatribe, her expression purposefully blase. 

“That’s just ridiculous that he only likes people 
like him,” she scolded when I’d finished spewing. 
“He likes you, and you’re not like him.” 




126/256 


“That’s the problem,” I mumbled. 

“Well, then deal with that. Don’t drag me into 
your drama,” she said. “Besides, I don’t really click 
with him, either.” 

“You don’t?” 

“No, Mia. Not everyone swoons for Adam.” 

“I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that I want you 
guys to be friends.” 

“Yeah, well, I want to live in New York City and 
have normal parents. As the man said, ‘You can’t al- 
ways get what you want.’” 

“But you’re two of the most important people in 
my life.” 

Kim looked at my red and teary face and her ex- 
pression softened into a gentle smile. “We know 
that, Mia. But we’re from different parts of your life, 
just like music and me are from different parts of 
your life. And that’s fine. You don’t have to choose 
one or the other, at least not as far as I’m 
concerned.” 

“But I want those parts of my life to come 
together.” 




127/256 


Kim shook her head. “It doesn’t work that way. 
Look, I accept Adam because you love him. And I 
assume he accepts me because you love me. If it 
makes you feel any better, your love binds us. And 
that’s enough. Me and him don’t have to love each 
other.” 

“But I want you to,” I wailed. 

“Mia,” Kim said, an edge of warning in her voice 
signaling the end of her patience. “You’re starting to 
act like one of those girls. Do you need to get me a 
gun?” 


Later that night, I stopped by Adam’s house to say I 
was sorry. He accepted my apology with a bemused 
kiss on the nose. And then nothing changed. He and 
Kim remained cordial but distant, no matter how 
much I tried to sell them on each other. The funny 
thing was, I never really bought into Kim’s notion 
that they were somehow bound together through 
me— until just now when I saw her half carrying him 
down the hospital corridor. 




128/256 

8:12 P.M. 


I watch Kim and Adam disappear down the hall. I 
mean to follow them but I’m glued to the linoleum, 
unable to move my phantom legs. It’s only after 
they disappear around a corner that I rouse myself 
and trail after them, but they’ve already gone inside 
the elevator. 

By now I’ve figured out that I don’t have any su- 
pernatural abilities. I can’t float through walls or 
dive down stairwells. I can only do the things I’d be 
able do in real life, except that apparently what I do 
in my world is invisible to everyone else. At least 
that seems to be the case because no one looks twice 
when I open doors or hit the elevator button. I can 
touch things, even manipulate door handles and the 
like, but I can’t really feel anything or anybody. It’s 
like I’m experiencing everything through a fish- 
bowl. It doesn’t really make sense to me, but then 
again, nothing that’s happening today makes much 
sense. 

I assume that Kim and Adam are headed to the 
waiting room to join the vigil, but when I get there, 
my family is not there. There’s a stack of coats and 
sweaters on the chairs and I recognize my cousin 




129/256 


Heather’s bright orange down jacket. She lives in 
the country and likes to hike in the woods, so she 
says that the neon colors are necessary to keep 
drunk hunters from mistaking her for a bear. 

I look at the clock on the wall. It could be dinner- 
time. I wander back down the halls to the cafeteria, 
which has the same fried-food, boiled-vegetable 
stench as cafeterias everywhere. Unappetizing smell 
aside, it’s full of people. The tables are crammed 
with doctors and nurses and nervous-looking med- 
ical students in short white jackets and stethoscopes 
so shiny that they look like toys. They are all chow- 
ing down on cardboard pizza and freeze-dried 
mashed potatoes. It takes me a while to locate my 
family, huddled around a table. Gran is chatting to 
Heather. Gramps is paying careful attention to his 
turkey sandwich. 

Aunt Kate and Aunt Diane are in the corner, 
whispering about something. “Some cuts and 
bruises. He was already released from the hospital,” 
Aunt Kate is saying, and for a second I think she’s 
talking about Teddy and am so excited I could cry. 
But then I hear her say something about there being 
no alcohol in his system, how our car just swerved 
into his lane and some guy named Mr. Dunlap says 
he didn’t have time to stop, and then I realize it’s 




130/256 


not Teddy they’re talking about; it’s the other 
driver. 

“The police said it was probably the snow, or a 
deer that caused them to swerve,” Aunt Kate contin- 
ues. “And apparently, this lopsided outcome is fairly 
common. One party is just fine and the other suffers 
catastrophic injuries . . .” She trails off. 

I don’t know that I’d call Mr. Dunlap “just fine,” 
no matter how superficial his injuries. I think about 
what it must be like to be him, to wake up one Tues- 
day morning and get into your truck to head off to 
work at the mill or maybe to the feed-supply store 
or maybe to Loretta’s Diner to have eggs over easy. 
Mr. Dunlap, who was maybe perfectly happy or per- 
fectly miserable, married with kids or a bachelor. 
But whatever and whoever he was early this morn- 
ing, he isn’t that person any longer. His life has 
changed irrevocably, too. If what my aunt says is 
true, and the crash wasn’t his fault, then he was 
what Kim would call “a poor schmuck,” in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. And because of his 
bad luck and because he was in his truck, driving 
eastbound on Route 27 this morning, two kids are 
now parentless and at least one of them is in grave 
condition. 




131/256 


How do you live with that? For a second, I have a 
fantasy of getting better and getting out of here and 
going to Mr. Dunlap’s house, to relieve him of his 
burden, to reassure him that it’s not his fault. 
Maybe we’d become friends. 

Of course, it probably wouldn’t work like that. It 
would be awkward and sad. Besides, I still have no 
idea what I will decide, still have no clue how I 
would determine to stay or not stay in the first 
place. Until I figure that out, I have to leave things 
up to the fates, or to the doctors, or whoever decides 
these matters when the decider is too confused to 
choose between the elevator and the stairs. 

I need Adam. I take a final look for him and Kim 
but they’re not here, so I head back upstairs to the 
ICU. 


I find them hiding out on the trauma floor, several 
halls away from the ICU. They’re trying to look cas- 
ual as they test out the doors to various supply 
closets. When they finally find an unlocked one, 
they sneak inside. They fumble around in the dark 
for a light switch. I hate to break it to them, but it’s 
actually back out in the hall. 




132/256 


“I’m not sure this kind of thing works outside of 
the movies,” Kim tells Adam as she feels along the 
wall. 

“Every fiction has its base in fact,” he tells her. 

“You don’t really look like the doctor type,” she 
says. 

“I was hoping for orderly. Or maybe janitor.” 

“Why would a janitor be in the ICU?” Kim asks. 
She’s a stickler for these kinds of details. 

“Broken lightbulb. I don’t know. It’s all in how 
you pull it off.” 

“I still don’t understand why you don’t just go to 
her family?” asks Kim, pragmatic as ever. “I’m sure 
her grandparents could explain, could get you in to 
see Mia.” 

Adam shakes his head. “You know, when the 
nurse threatened to call security, my first thought 
was Til just call Mia’s parents to fix this.’” Adam 
stops, takes a few breaths. “It just keeps walloping 
me over and over, and it’s like it’s the first time 
every time,” he says in a husky voice. 

“I know,” Kim replies in a whisper. 




133/256 


“Anyhow,” Adam says, resuming his search for 
the light switch, “I can’t go to her grandparents. I 
can’t add anything more to their burden. This is 
something I have to do for myself.” 

I’m sure my grandparents would actually be 
happy to help Adam. They’ve met him a bunch of 
times, and they like him a lot. On Christmas, Gran is 
always sure to make maple fudge for him because 
he once mentioned how much he liked it. 

But I also know that sometimes Adam needs to do 
things the dramatic way. He is fond of the Grand 
Gesture. Like saving up two weeks of pizza-delivery 
tips to take me to Yo-Yo Ma instead of just asking 
me out on a regular date. Like decorating my win- 
dowsill with flowers every day for a week when I 
was contagious with the chicken pox. 

Now I can see that Adam is concentrating on the 
new task at hand. I’m not sure what exactly he has 
in mind, but whatever the plan, I’m grateful for it, if 
only because it’s pulled him out of his emotional 
stupor I saw in the hallway outside the ICU. I’ve 
seen him get like this before, when he’s writing a 
new song or is trying to convince me to do 
something I won’t want to do— like go camping with 
him— and nothing, not a meteorite crashing into the 




134/256 


planet, not even a girlfriend in the ICU, can dis- 
suade him. 

Besides, it’s the girlfriend in the ICU that’s neces- 
sitating Adam’s ruse to begin with. And from what I 
can guess, it’s the oldest hospital trick in the book, 
taken straight from that movie The Fugitive, which 
Mom and I recently watched on TNT. I have my 
doubts about it. So does Kim. 

“Don’t you think that nurse might recognize 
you?” Kim asks. “You did yell at her.” 

“She won’t have to recognize me if she doesn’t see 
me. Now I get why you and Mia are such peas in a 
pod. A pair of Cassandras.” 

Adam has never met Mrs. Schein, so he doesn’t 
get that implying that Kim is a worrywart is fighting 
words. Kim scowls, but then I can see her give in. 
“Maybe this retarded plan of yours would work bet- 
ter if we could actually see what we’re doing.” She 
fumbles around in her bag and pulls out the cell 
phone her mother made her start carrying when she 
was ten— child LoJack, Kim called it— and turned on 
the monitor. A square of light softens the darkness. 




135/256 


“Now, that’s more like the brilliant girl Mia brags 
about,” Adam says. He turns on his own cell phone 
and now the room is illuminated by a dull glow. 

Unfortunately, the glow shows that the tiny 
broom closet is full of brooms, a bucket, and a pair 
of mops, but is lacking any of the disguises that 
Adam was hoping for. If I could, I would inform 
them that the hospital has locker rooms, where the 
doctors and nurses can stow their street clothes and 
where they change into their scrubs or their lab 
coats. The only generic hospital garb sitting around 
are those embarrassing gowns that they put the pa- 
tients in. Adam probably could throw on a gown 
and cruise the hallways in a wheelchair with no one 
the wiser, but such a getup would still not get him 
into the ICU. 

“Shit,” Adam says. 

“We can keep trying,” Kim says, suddenly the 
cheer-leader. “There are like ten floors in this place. 
I’m sure there are other unlocked closets.” 

Adam sinks to the floor. “Nah. You’re right. This 
is stupid. We need to come up with a better plan.” 

“You could fake a drug overdose or something so 
you wind up in the ICU,” Kim says. 




136/256 


“This is Portland. You’re lucky if a drug overdose 
gets you into the ER,” Adam replies. “No, I was 
thinking more like a distraction. You know, like 
making the fire alarm go off so the nurses all come 
running out.” 

“Do you really think sprinklers and panicked 
nurses are good for Mia?” Kim asks. 

“Well, not that exactly, but something so that they 
all look away for half a second and I stealthily sneak 
in.” 

“They’ll find you out right away. They’ll throw you 
out on your backside.” 

“I don’t care,” Adam responds. “I only need a 
second.” 

“Why? I mean what can you do in a second?” 

Adam pauses for a second. His eyes, which are 
normally a kind of mutt’s mixture of gray and 
brown and green, have gone dark. “So I can show 
her that I’m here. That someone’s still here.” 

Kim doesn’t ask any more questions after that. 
They sit there in silence, each lost in their own 
thoughts, and it reminds me of how Adam and I can 
be together but quiet and separate and I realize that 




137/256 


they’re friends now, friends for real. No matter what 
happens, at least I have achieved that. 

After about five minutes, Adam knocks on his 
forehead. 

“Of course,” he says. 

“What?” 

“Time to activate the Bat Signal.” 

“Huh?” 

“Come on. I’ll show you.” 


When I first started playing the cello, Dad was still 
playing drums in his band, though that all started to 
taper off a couple years later when Teddy arrived. 
But right from the get-go, I could see that there was 
something different about playing my kind of mu- 
sic, something more than my parents’ obvious be- 
wilderment with my classical tastes. My music was 
solitary. I mean Dad might hammer on his drums 
for a few hours by himself or write songs alone at 
the kitchen table, plinking out the notes on his beat- 
up acoustic guitar, but he always said that songs 


138/256 


really got written as you played them. That was 
what made it so interesting. 

When I played, it was most often by myself, in my 
room. Even when I practiced with the rotating col- 
lege students, other than during lessons, I still usu- 
ally played solo. And when I gave a concert or recit- 
al, it was alone, on a stage, my cello, myself, and an 
audience. And unlike Dad’s shows, where enthusi- 
astic fans jumped the stage and then dive-bombed 
into the crowd, there was always a wall between the 
audience and me. After a while playing like this got 
lonely. It also got kind of boring. 

So in the spring of eighth grade I decided to quit. 
I planned to trail off quietly, by cutting back my ob- 
sessive practices, not giving recitals. I figured that if 
I laid off gradually, by the time I entered high 
school in the fall, I could start fresh, no longer be 
known as “the cellist.” Maybe then I’d pick up a new 
instrument, guitar or bass, or even drums. Plus, 
with Mom too busy with Teddy to notice the length 
of my cello practice, and Dad swamped with lesson 
plans and grading papers at his new teaching job, I 
figured nobody would even realize that I’d stopped 
playing until it was already a done deal. At least 
that’s what I told myself. The truth was, I could no 




139/256 


sooner quit cello cold turkey than I could stop 
breathing. 

I might have quit for real, were it not for Kim. 
One afternoon, I invited her to go downtown with 
me after school. 

“It’s a weekday. Don’t you have practice?” she 
asked as she twisted the combination on her locker. 

“I can skip it today,” I said, pretending to search 
for my earth-science book. 

“Have the pod people stolen Mia? First no recit- 
als. And now you’re skipping out on practice. 
What’s going on?” 

“I don’t know,” I said, tapping my fingers against 
the locker. “I’m thinking of trying a new instrument. 
Like drums. Dad’s kit is down in the basement gath- 
ering dust.” 

“Yeah, right. You on drums. That’s rich,” Kim said 
with a chuckle. 

“I’m serious.” 

Kim had looked at me, her mouth agape, like I’d 
just told her I planned on sauteing up a platter of 
slugs for dinner. “You can’t quit cello,” she said after 
a moment of stunned silence. 




140/256 


“Why not?” 

She looked pained as the tried to explain. “I don’t 
know but it just seems like your cello is part of who 
you are. I can’t imagine you without that thing 
between your legs.” 

“It’s stupid. I can’t even play in the school march- 
ing band. I mean, who plays the cello anyhow? A 
bunch of old people. It’s a dumb instrument for a 
girl to play. It’s so dorky. And I want to have more 
free time, to do fun stuff.” 

“What kind of ‘fun stuff?” Kim challenged. 

“Um, you know? Shopping. Hanging out with you 

“Please,” Kim said. “You hate to shop. And you 
hang out with me plenty. But fine, skip practice 
today. I want to show you something.” She took me 
home with her and dragged out a CD of Nirvana 
MTV Unplugged and played me “Something in the 
Way.” 

“Listen to that,” she said. “Two guitar players, a 
drummer, and a cello player. Her name is Lori 
Goldston and I bet when she was younger, she prac- 
ticed two hours a day like some other girl I know be- 
cause if you want to play with the philharmonic, or 




141/256 


with Nirvana, that’s what you have to do. And I 
don’t think anyone would dare call her a dork.” 

I took the CD home and listened to it over and 
over for the next week, pondering what Kim said. I 
pulled my cello out a few times, played along. It was 
a different kind of music than I’d played before, 
challenging, and strangely invigorating. I planned to 
play “Something in the Way” for Kim the following 
week when she came over for dinner. 

But before I had a chance, at the dinner table Kim 
casually announced to my parents that she thought 
I ought to go to summer camp. 

“What, you trying to convert me so I’ll go to your 
Torah camp?” I asked. 

“Nope. It’s music camp.” She pulled out a glossy 
brochure for the Franklin Valley Conservatory, a 
summer program in British Columbia. “It’s for seri- 
ous musicians,” Kim said. “You have to send a re- 
cording of your playing to get in. I called. The dead- 
line for applications is May first, so there’s still 
time.” She turned to face me head-on, as if she were 
daring me to get mad at her for interfering. 

I wasn’t mad. My heart was pounding, as if Kim 
had announced that my family won a lottery and 




142/256 


she was about to reveal how much. I looked at her, 
the nervous look in her eyes betraying the “you 
wanna piece of me?” smirk on her face, and I was 
overwhelmed with gratitude to be friends with 
someone who often seemed to understand me bet- 
ter than I understood myself. Dad asked me if I 
wanted to go, and when I protested about the 
money, he said never mind about that. Did I want to 
go? And I did. More than anything. 


Three months later, when Dad dropped me off in a 
lonely corner of Vancouver Island, I wasn’t so sure. 
The place looked like a typical summer camp, log 
cabins in the woods, kayaks strewn on the beach. 
There were about fifty kids who, judging by the way 
they were hugging and squealing, had all known one 
another for years. Meanwhile, I didn’t know any- 
body. For the first six hours, no one talked to me ex- 
cept for the camp’s assistant director, who assigned 
me to a cabin, showed me my bunk bed, and poin- 
ted the way to the cafeteria, where that night, I was 
given a plate of something that appeared to be meat 
loaf. 

I stared miserably at my plate, looking out at the 
gloomy gray evening. I already missed my parents, 




143/256 


Kim, and especially Teddy. He was at that fun stage, 
wanting to try new things and constantly asking 
“What’s that?” and saying the most hilarious things. 
The day before I left, he informed me that he was 
“nine-tenths thirsty” and I almost peed myself 
laughing. Homesick, I sighed and moved the mass 
of meat loaf around my plate. 

“Don’t worry, it doesn’t rain every day. Just every 
other day.” 

I looked up. There was an impish kid who 
couldn’t have been more than ten years old. He had 
a blond buzz cut and a constellation of freckles fall- 
ing down his nose. 

“I know,” I said. “I’m from the Northwest, though 
it was sunny where I lived this morning. It’s the 
meat loaf I’m worried about.” 

He laughed. “That doesn’t get better. But the 
peanut-butter-and-jelly is always good,” he said, 
gesturing to a table where a half-dozen kids were 
fixing themselves sandwiches. “Peter. Trombone. 
Ontario,” he said. This, I would learn, was standard 
Franklin greeting. 

“Oh, hey. I’m Mia. Cello. Oregon, I guess.” 




144/256 


Peter told me that he was thirteen, and this was 
his second summer here; almost everyone started 
when they were twelve, which is why they all knew 
one another. Of the fifty students, about half did 
jazz, the other half classical, so it was a small crew. 
There were only two other cello players, one of them 
a tall lanky red-haired guy named Simon who Peter 
waved over. 

“Will you be trying for the concerto competition?” 
Simon asked me as soon as Peter introduced me as 
Mia. Cello. Oregon. Simon was Simon. Cello. 
Leicester, which turned out to be a city in England. 
It was quite the international group. 

“I don’t think so. I don’t even know what that is,” 
I answered. 

“Well, you know how we all perform in an orches- 
tra for the final symphony?” Peter asked me. 

I nodded my head, though really I had only a 
vague idea. Dad had spent the spring reading out 
loud from the camp’s literature, but the only thing 
I’d cared about was that I was going to camp with 
other classical musicians. I hadn’t paid too much at- 
tention to the details. 




145/256 


“It’s the summer’s end symphony. People from all 
over come to it. It’s a quite a big deal. We, the 
youngster musicians, play as a sort of cute 
sideshow,” Simon explained. “However, one musi- 
cian from the camp is chosen to play with the pro- 
fessional orchestra and to perform a solo move- 
ment. I came close last year but it went to a flutist. 
This is my second-to-last chance before I graduate. 
It hasn’t gone to strings in a while, and Tracy, the 
third of our little trio here, isn’t trying out. She’s 
more of a hobby player. Good but not terribly seri- 
ous. I heard you were serious.” 

Was I? Not so serious that I hadn’t been on the 
verge of quitting. “How’d you hear that?” I asked. 

“The teachers hear all the application reels and 
word gets around. Your audition tape was appar- 
ently quite good. It’s unusual to admit someone in 
year two. So I was hoping for some bloody good 
competition, to up my game, as it were.” 

“Whoa, give the girl a chance,” Peter said. “She’s 
only just tasted the meat loaf.” 

Simon shriveled his nose. “Beg pardon. But if you 
want to put heads together about audition choices, 
let’s have a little chat about that,” he said, and dis- 
appeared off in the direction of the sundae bar. 




146/256 


“Forgive Simon. We haven’t had high-quality cel- 
lists for a couple years, so he’s excited about new 
blood. In a purely aesthetic way. He’s queer, though 
it may be hard to tell because he’s English.” 

“Oh. I see. But what did he say? I mean it sounds 
like he wants me to compete against him.” 

“Of course he does. That’s the fun. That’s why 
we’re all at camp in the middle of a flipping rain 
forest,” he said, gesturing outside. “That and the 
amazing cuisine.” Peter looked at me. “Isn’t that 
why you’re here?” 

I shrugged. “I don’t know. I haven’t played with 
that many people, at least that many serious 
people.” 

Peter scratched his ears. “Really? You said you’re 
from Oregon. Ever done anything with the Portland 
Cello Project?” 

“The what?” 

“Avant-garde cello collective, eh. Very interesting 
work.” 

“I don’t live in Portland,” I mumbled, embar- 
rassed that I’d never even heard of any Cello 
Project. 




147/256 


“Well then, who do you play with?” 

“Other people. College students mostly.” 

“No orchestra? No chamber-music ensemble? 
String quartet?” 

I shook my head, remembering a time when one 
of my student teachers invited me to play in a quar- 
tet. I’d turned her down because playing one-on-one 
with her was one thing; playing with complete 
strangers was another. I’d always believed that the 
cello was a solitary instrument, but now I was start- 
ing to wonder if maybe I was the solitary one. 

“Hmm. How are you any good?” Peter asked. “I 
don’t mean to sound like an asshole, but isn’t that 
how you get good? It’s like tennis. If you play 
someone crappy, you end up missing shots or 
serving all sloppy, but if you play with an ace player, 
suddenly you’re all at the net, lobbing good volleys.” 

“I wouldn’t know,” I told Peter, feeling like the 
most boring, sheltered person ever. “I don’t play 
tennis, either.” 


The next few days went by in a blur. I had no idea 
why they put out the kayaks. There was no time for 
playing. Not that kind, anyway. The days were 




148/256 


totally grueling. Up at six-thirty, breakfast by seven, 
private study time for three hours in the morning 
and in the afternoon, and orchestra rehearsal before 
dinner. 

I’d never played with more than a handful of mu- 
sicians before, so the first few days in orchestra 
were chaotic. The camp’s musical director, who was 
also the conductor, scrambled to get us situated and 
then it was everything he could do to get us playing 
the most basic of movements in any semblance of 
time. On the third day, he trotted out some Brahms 
lullabies. The first time we played, it was painful. 
The instruments didn’t blend so much as collide, 
like rocks caught in a lawn mower. “Terrible!” he 
screamed. “How can any of you ever expect to play 
in a professional orchestra if you cannot keep time 
on a lullaby? Now again!” 

After about a week, it started to gel and I got my 
first taste of being a cog in the machine. It made me 
hear the cello in an entirely new way, how its low 
tones worked in concert with the viola’s higher 
notes, how it provided a foundation for the wood- 
winds on the other side of the orchestra pit. And 
even though you might think that being part of a 
group would make you relax a little, not care so 




149/256 


much how you sounded blended among everyone 
else, if anything, the opposite was true. 

I sat behind a seventeen-year-old viola player 
named Elizabeth. She was one of the most accom- 
plished musicians in the camp— she’d been accepted 
into the Royal Conservatory of Music in 
Toronto— and she was also model-gorgeous: tall, 
regal, with skin the color of coffee, and cheekbones 
that could carve ice. I would’ve been tempted to 
hate her were it not for her playing. If you’re not 
careful, the viola can make the most awful screech, 
even in the hands of practiced musicians. But with 
Elizabeth the sound rang out clean and pure and 
light. Hearing her play, and watching how deeply 
she lost herself in the music, I wanted to play like 
that. Better even. It wasn’t just that I wanted to beat 
her, but also that I felt like I owed it to her, to the 
group, to myself, to play at her level. 


“That’s sounding quite beautiful,” Simon said to- 
ward the end of camp as he listened to me practice a 
movement from Hayden’s Cello Concerto no. 2, a 
piece that had given me no end of trouble when I’d 
first attempted it last spring. “Are you using that for 
the concerto competition?” 




150/256 


I nodded. Then I couldn’t help myself, I grinned. 
After dinner and before lights-out every night, Si- 
mon and I had been bringing our cellos outside to 
hold impromptu concerts in the long twilight. We 
took turns challenging each other to cello duels, 
each trying to out-crazy-play the other. We were al- 
ways competing, always trying to see who could 
play something better, faster, from memory. It had 
been so much fun, and was probably one reason 
why I was feeling so good about the Hayden. 

“Ahh, someone’s awfully confident. Think you can 
beat me?” Simon asked. 

“At soccer. Definitely,” I joked. Simon often told 
us that he was the black sheep in his family not be- 
cause he was gay, or a musician, but because he was 
such a “shitey footballer.” 

Simon pretended that I’d shot him in the heart. 
Then he laughed. “Amazing things happen when 
you stop hiding behind that hulking beast,” he said, 
gesturing to my cello. I nodded. Simon smiled at 
me. “Well, don’t go getting quite so cocky. You 
should hear my Mozart. It sounds like the bloody 
angels singing.” 




151/256 


Neither one of us won the solo spot that year. El- 
izabeth did. And though it would take me four more 
years, eventually I’d nab the solo. 


9:06 P.M. 

“I’ve got exactly twenty minutes before our manager 
has a total shit fit.” Brooke Vega’s raspy voice 
booms in the hospital’s now-quiet lobby. So this is 
Adam’s idea: Brooke Vega, the indie-music goddess 
and lead singer of Bikini. In a trademark punky 
glam outfit— tonight it’s a short bubble skirt, fish- 
nets, high black leather boots, an artfully ripped-up 
Shooting Star T-shirt, topped off with a vintage fur 
shrug and a pair of black Jackie O glasses— she 
stands out in the hospital lobby like an ostrich in a 
chicken coop. She’s surrounded by people: Liz and 
Sarah; Mike and Fitzy, Shooting Star’s rhythm gui- 
tarist and bass player, respectively, plus a handful of 
Portland hipsters who I vaguely recognize. With her 
magenta hair, she’s like the sun, around which her 
admiring planets revolve. Adam is like a moon, 




152/256 


standing off to the side, stroking his chin. Mean- 
while, Kim looks shell-shocked, like a bunch of Mar- 
tians just entered the building. Or maybe it’s be- 
cause Kim worships Brooke Vega. In fact, so does 
Adam. Aside from me, this was one of the few things 
they had in common. 

“I’ll have you out of here in fifteen,” Adam prom- 
ises, stepping into her galaxy. 

She strides toward him. “Adam, baby,” she 
croons. “How you holding up?” Brooke encircles 
him in a hug as if they are old friends, though I 
know that they only met for the first time today; just 
yesterday Adam was saying how nervous he was 
about it. But now she’s here acting like his best 
friend. That’s the power of the scene, I guess. As she 
embraces Adam, I see every guy and girl in that 
lobby watch hungrily, wishing, I imagine, that their 
own significant other were upstairs in grave condi- 
tion so that they might be the ones getting the con- 
solatory cuddle from Brooke. 

I can’t help but wonder if I were here, if I were 
watching this as regular old Mia, would I feel jeal- 
ous, too? Then again, if I were regular old Mia, 
Brooke Vega would not be in this hospital lobby as 
part of some great ruse to get Adam in to see me. 




153/256 


“Okay, kids. Time to rock-and-roll. Adam, what’s 
the plan?” Brooke asks. 

“You are the plan. I hadn’t really thought beyond 
you going up to the ICU and making a ruckus.” 

Brooke licks her bee-stung lips. “Making a ruckus 
is one of my favorite things to do. What do you 
think we should do? Let out a primal scream? Strip? 
Smash a guitar? Wait, I didn’t bring my guitar. 
Damn.” 

“You could sing something?” someone suggests. 

“How about that old Smiths song ‘Girlfriend in a 
Coma’?” someone calls. 

Adam blanches at this sudden reality check and 
Brooke raises her eyebrows in a stern rebuke. 
Everyone goes serious. 

Kim clears her throat. “Um, it doesn’t do us any 
good if Brooke is a diversion in the lobby. We need 
to go upstairs to the ICU and then maybe someone 
could shout that Brooke Vega is here. That might do 
it. If it doesn’t, then sing. All we really want is to 
lure a couple of curious nurses out, and that 
grouchy head nurse after them. Once she comes out 
of the ICU and sees all of us in the hall, she’ll be too 




154/256 


busy dealing with us to notice that Adam has 
slipped inside.” 

Brooke appraises Kim. Kim in her rumpled black 
pants and unflattering sweater. Then Brooke smiles 
and links arms with my best friend. “Sounds like a 
plan. Let’s motor, kids.” 

I lag behind, watching this procession of hipsters 
barrel through the lobby. The sheer noisiness of 
them, of their heavy boots, and loud voices, buzzed 
on by their sense of urgency, ricochets through the 
quiet hush of the hospital and breathes some life in- 
to the place. I remember watching a TV program 
once about old-age homes that brought in cats and 
dogs to cheer the elderly and dying patients. Maybe 
all hospitals should import groups of rabble-rousing 
punk rockers to kick-start the languishing patients’ 
hearts. 

They stop in front of the elevator, waiting end- 
lessly for one empty enough to ferry them up as a 
group. I decide that I want to be next to my body 
when Adam makes it to the ICU. I wonder if I will 
be able to feel his touch on me. While they wait at 
the elevator banks, I scramble up the stairs. 

I’ve been gone from the ICU for more than two 
hours, and a lot has changed. There is a new patient 




155/256 


in one of the empty beds, a middle-aged man whose 
face looks like one of those surrealist paintings: half 
of it looks normal, handsome even, the other half is 
a mess of blood, gauze, and stitching, like someone 
just blew it off. Maybe a gunshot wound. We get a 
lot of hunting accidents around here. One of the 
other patients, one who was so swaddled in gauze 
and bandages that I couldn’t see if he/she was a 
man or woman, is gone. In his/her place is a woman 
whose neck is immobilized in one of those collar 
things. 

As for me, I’m off my ventilator now. I remember 
the social worker telling my grandparents and Aunt 
Diane that this was a positive step. I stop to check if 
I feel any different, but I don’t feel anything, not 
physically anyhow. I haven’t since I was in the car 
this morning, listening to Beethoven’s Cello Sonata 
no. 3. Now that I’m breathing on my own, my wall 
of machines bleeps far less, so I get fewer visits from 
the nurses. Nurse Ramirez, the one with the nails, 
looks over at me every now and again, but she’s 
busy with the new guy with the half face. 

“Holy crud. Is that Brooke Vega?” I hear someone 
ask in a totally fakey dramatic voice from outside 
the ICU’s automatic doors. I’ve never heard any of 




156/256 


Adam’s friends talk so PG-13 before. It’s their sanit- 
ized hospital version of “holy fucking shit.” 

“You mean Brooke Vega of Bikini? Brooke Vega 
who was on the cover of Spin magazine last month? 
Here in this very hospital?” This time it’s Kim talk- 
ing. She sounds like a six-year-old reciting lines 
from a school play about the food groups: You mean 
you’re supposed to eat five servings of fruit and ve- 
getables a day? 

“Yeah, that’s right,” says Brooke’s raspy voice. 
“I’m here to offer some rock-and-roll succor to all 
the people of Portland.” 

A couple of the younger nurses, the ones who 
probably listen to pop radio or watch MTV and have 
heard of Bikini, look up, their faces excited question 
marks. I hear them whispering, eager to see if it’s 
really Brooke, or maybe just happy for the break in 
the routine. 

“Yeah. That’s right. So I thought I might sing a 
little song. One of my favorites. It’s called ‘Eraser,’” 
Brooke says. “One of you guys want to count me 
in?” 

“I need something to tap with,” Liz answers. 
“Anyone got some pens or something?” 




157/256 


Now the nurses and orderlies in the ICU are very 
curious and heading toward the doors. I’m watching 
it all play out, like a movie on the screen. I stand 
next to my bed, my eyes trained on the double 
doors, waiting for them to open. I’m itching with 
suspense. I think of Adam, of how calming it feels 
when he touches me, how when he absentmindedly 
strokes the nape of my neck or blows warm air on 
my cold hands, I could melt into a puddle. 

“What’s going on?” the older nurse demands. 
Suddenly every nurse on the floor is looking at her, 
not out toward Brooke anymore. No one is going to 
try to explain to her that a famous pop star is out- 
side. The moment has broken. I feel the tension 
ease into disappointment. The door isn’t going to 
open. 

Outside, I hear Brooke start belting out the lyrics 
to “Eraser.” Even a cappella, even through the auto- 
matic double doors, she sounds good. 

“Somebody call security now,” the nurse growls. 

“Adam, you better just go for it,” Liz yells. “Now 
or never. Full-court press.” 

“Go!” screams Kim, suddenly an army general. 
“We’ll cover you.” 




158/256 


The door opens. In tumble more than a half- 
dozen punkers, Adam, Liz, Fitzy, some people I 
don’t know, and then Kim. Outside, Brooke is still 
singing, as though this were the concert she’d come 
to Portland to give. 

As Adam and Kim charge through the door, they 
both look determined, happy even. I’m amazed by 
their resilience, by their hidden pockets of strength. 
I want to jump up and down and root for them like I 
used to do at Teddy’s T-ball games when he’d be 
rounding third and heading for home. It’s hard to 
believe, but watching Kim and Adam in action, I al- 
most feel happy, too. 

“Where is she?” Adam yells. “Where’s Mia?” 

“In the corner, next to the supply closet!” 
someone shouts. It takes me a minute to realize it’s 
Nurse Ramirez. 

“Security! Get him! Get him!” the grumpy nurse 
shouts. She has spotted Adam through all the other 
invaders and her face has gone pink with anger. 
Two hospital security guards and two orderlies run 
inside. “Dude, was that Brooke Vega?” one asks as 
he snags Fitzy and flings him toward the exit. 




159/256 


“Think so,” the other answers, grabbing Sarah 
and steering her out. 

Kim has spotted me. “Adam, she’s here!” she 
screams, and then turns to look at me, the scream 
dying in her throat. “She’s here,” she says again, 
only this time it’s a whimper. 

Adam hears her and he is dodging nurses and 
making his way to me. And then he’s there at the 
foot of my bed, his hand reaching out to touch me. 
His hand about to be on me. Suddenly I think of our 
first kiss after the Yo-Yo Ma concert, how I didn’t 
know how badly I’d wanted his lips on mine until 
the kiss was imminent. I didn’t realize just how 
much I was craving his touch, until now that I can 
almost feel it on me. 

Almost. But suddenly he’s moving away from me. 
Two guards have him by the shoulders and have 
yanked him back. One of the same guards grabs 
Kim’s elbow and leads her out. She’s limp now, of- 
fering no resistance. 

Brooke’s still singing in the hallway. When she 
sees Adam, she stops. “Sorry, honey,” she says. “I 
gotta jet before I miss my show. Or get arrested.” 
And then she’s off down the hall, trailed by a couple 
of orderlies begging for her autograph. 




160/256 


“Call the police,” the old nurse yells. “Have him 
arrested.” 

“We’re taking him down to security. That’s pro- 
tocol,” one guard says. 

“Not up to us to arrest,” the other adds. 

“Just get him off my ward.” She harrumphs and 
turns around. “Miss Ramirez, that had better not 
have been you abetting these hoodlums.” 

“Of course not. I was in the supply closet. I 
missed all the hubbub,” she replies. She’s such a 
good liar that her face gives nothing away. 

The old nurse claps her hands. “Okay. Show’s 
over. Back to work.” 

I chase after Adam and Kim, who are being led in- 
to the elevators. I jump in with them. Kim looks 
dazed, like someone flipped her reset button and 
she’s still booting up. Adam’s lips are set in a grim 
line. I can’t tell if he’s about to cry or about to punch 
the guard. For his sake, I hope it’s the former. For 
my own, I hope the latter. 

Downstairs, the guards hustle Adam and Kim to- 
ward a hallway filled with darkened offices. They’re 
about to go inside one of the few offices with lights 
on when I hear someone scream Adam’s name. 




161/256 

“Adam. Stop. Is that you?” 

“Willow?” Adam yells. 

“Willow?” Kim mumbles. 

“Excuse me, where are you taking them?” Willow 
yells at the guards as she runs toward them. 

“I’m sorry but these two were caught trying to 
break into the ICU,” one guard explains. 

“Only because they wouldn’t let us in,” Kim ex- 
plains weakly. 

Willow catches up to them. She’s still wearing her 
nursing clothes, which is strange, because she nor- 
mally changes out of what she calls “orthopedic cou- 
ture” as soon as she can. Her long, curly auburn hair 
looks lank and greasy, like she’s forgotten to wash it 
these past few weeks. And her cheeks, normally rosy 
like apples, have been repainted beige. “Excuse me. 

I’m an RN over at Cedar Creek. I did my training 
here, so if you like we can go straighten this out with 
Richard Caruthers.” 

“Who’s he?” one guard asks. 

“Director of community affairs,” the other replies. 
Then he turns to Willow. “He’s not here. It’s not 
business hours.” 




162/256 


“Well, I have his home number,” Willow says, 
brandishing her cell phone like a weapon. “I doubt 
he’d be pleased if I were to call him now and tell 
him how his hospital was treating someone trying to 
visit his critically wounded girlfriend. You know 
that the director values compassion as much as effi- 
ciency, and this is not the way to treat a concerned 
loved one.” 

“We’re just doing our job, ma’am. Following 
orders.” 

“How about I save you two the trouble and take it 
from here. The patient’s family is all assembled up- 
stairs. They’re waiting for these two to join them. 
Here, if you have any problems, you tell Mr. Caruth- 
ers to get in touch with me.” She reaches into her 
bag and pulls out a card and hands it over. One of 
the guards looks at it, hands it to the other, who 
stares at it and shrugs. 

“Might as well save ourselves the paperwork,” he 
says. He lets go of Adam, whose body slumps like a 
scarecrow taken off his pole. “Sorry, kid,” he says to 
Adam, brushing off his shoulders. 

“I hope your girlfriend’s okay,” the other 
mumbles. And then they disappear toward the glow 
of some vending machines. 




163/256 


Kim, who has met Willow all of twice, flings her- 
self into her arms. “Thank you!” she murmurs into 
her neck. 

Willow hugs her back, pats her on the shoulders 
before letting go. She rubs her eyes and winces out a 
brittle laugh. “What in the hell were you two think- 
ing?” she asks. 

“I want to see Mia,” Adam says. 

Willow turns to look at Adam and it’s like 
someone has unscrewed her valve, letting all her air 
escape. She deflates. She reaches out and touches 
Adam’s cheek. “Of course you do.” She wipes her 
eyes with the heel of her hand. 

“Are you okay?” Kim asks. 

Willow ignores the question. “Let’s see about get- 
ting you in to Mia.” 

Adam perks up when he hears this. “You think 
you can? That old nurse has it in for me.” 

“If that old nurse is who I think she is, it doesn’t 
matter if she has it in for you. It’s not up to her. 
Let’s check in with Mia’s grandparents and then I’ll 
find out who’s in charge of breaking the rules 
around here and get you in to see your girl. She 
needs you now. More than ever.” 




164/256 


Adam swivels around and hugs Willow with such 
force that her feet lift up off the ground. 

Willow to the rescue. Just the way she rescued 
Henry, Dad’s best friend and bandmate, who, once 
upon a time, was a total drunk playboy. When he 
and Willow had been dating a few weeks, she told 
him to straighten out and dry out or say good-bye. 
Dad said that lots of girls had given Henry ultimat- 
ums, tried to force him to settle down, and lots of 
girls had been left crying on the sidewalk. But when 
Willow packed her toothbrush and told Henry to 
grow up, Henry was the one who cried. Then he 
dried his tears, grew up, got sober and monogam- 
ous. Eight years later, here they are, with a baby, no 
less. Willow is formidable that way. Probably why 
after she and Henry got together she became Mom’s 
best friend; she was another tough-as-nails, tender- 
as-kittens, feminist bitch. And probably why she 
was one of Dad’s favorite people, even though she 
hated the Ramones and thought baseball was bor- 
ing, while Dad lived for the Ramones and thought 
baseball was a religious institution. 

Now Willow is here. Willow the nurse. Willow 
who doesn’t take no for an answer is here. She’ll get 
Adam in to see me. She’ll take care of everything. 
Hooray! I want to shout. Willow is here! 




165/256 


I’m so busy celebrating Willow’s arrival that the 
implication of her being here takes a few moments 
to sink in, but when it does, it hits me like a jolt of 
electricity. 

Willow is here. And if she’s here, if she’s in my 
hospital, it means that there isn’t any reason for her 
to be in her hospital. I know her well enough to 
know that she never would have left him there. 
Even with me here, she would’ve stayed with him. 
He was broken, and brought to her for fixing. He 
was her patient. Her priority. 

I think about the fact that Gran and Gramps are 
in Portland with me. And that all anyone in that 
waiting room is talking about is me, how they are 
avoiding mentioning Mom or Dad or Teddy. I think 
about Willow’s face, which looks like it has been 
scrubbed clean of all joy. And I think about what 
she told Adam, that I need him now. More than 
ever. 

And that’s how I know. Teddy. He’s gone, too. 


166/256 


Mom went into labor three days before Christmas, 
and she insisted we go holiday shopping together. 

“Shouldn’t you like lie down or go to the birthing 
center or something?” I asked. 

Mom grimaced through a cramp. “Nah. The con- 
tractions aren’t that bad and are still like twenty 
minutes apart. I cleaned our entire house, from top 
to bottom, while I was in early labor with you.” 

“Putting the labor in labor,” I joked. 

“You’re a smart-ass, you know that?” Mom said. 
She took a few breaths. “I’ve got a ways to go. Now 
come on. Let’s take the bus to the mall. I’m not up 
to driving.” 

“Shouldn’t we call Dad?” I asked. 

Mom laughed at that. “Please, it’s enough for me 
to have to birth this baby. I don’t need to deal with 
him, too. We’ll call him when I’m ready to pop. I’d 
much rather have you around.” 

So Mom and I wandered around the mall, stop- 
ping every couple minutes so she could sit down 
and take deep breaths and squeeze my wrist so hard 
it left angry red marks. Still, it was a weirdly fun and 
productive morning. We bought presents for Gran 
and Gramps (a sweater with an angel on it and a 




167/256 


new book about Abraham Lincoln) and toys for the 
baby and a new pair of rain boots for me. Usually we 
waited for the holiday sales to buy stuff like that, 
but Mom said that this year we’d be too busy chan- 
ging diapers. “Now’s not the time to be cheap. Ow, 
fuck. Sorry, Mia. Come on. Let’s go get pie.” 

We went to Marie Callender’s. Mom had a slice of 
pumpkin and of banana cream. I had blueberry. 
When she was done, she pushed her plate away and 
announced she was ready to go to the midwife. 

We’d never really talked about my being there or 
not being there. I went everywhere with Mom and 
Dad at that point, so it was just kind of assumed. 
We met a nerve-racked Dad at the birthing center, 
which was nothing like a doctor’s office. It was the 
ground floor of a house, the inside decked out with 
beds and Jacuzzi tubs, the medical equipment dis- 
creetly tucked away. The hippie midwife led Mom 
inside and Dad asked me if I wanted to come, too. 
By now, I could hear Mom screaming profanities. 

“I can call Gran and she’ll pick you up,” Dad said, 
wincing at Mom’s barrage. “This might take a 
while.” 

I shook my head. Mom needed me. She’d said so. 
I sat down on one of the floral couches and picked 




168/256 


up a magazine with a goofy-looking bald baby on 
the cover. Dad disappeared into the room with the 
bed. 

“Music! Goddammit! Music!” Mom screamed. 

“We have some lovely Enya. Very soothing,” the 
midwife said. 

“Fuck Enya!” Mom screamed. “Melvins. Earth. 
Now!” 

“Eve got it covered,” Dad said. Then he popped a 
CD of the loudest, churningest, guitar-heaviest mu- 
sic Ed ever heard. It made all the fast-paced punk 
songs Dad normally listened to sound like harp mu- 
sic. This music was primal and that seemed to make 
Mom feel better. She started making these low gut- 
tural noises. I just sat there quietly. Every so often 
she’d scream my name and Ed scamper inside. 
Mom would look up at me, her face plastered with 
sweat. Don’t be scared , she’d whisper. Women can 
handle the worst kind of pain. You’ll find out one 
day. Then she’d scream fuck again. 

Ed seen a couple of births on that cable-TV show, 
and people usually yelled for a while; sometimes 
they swore and it had to be bleeped, but it never 
took longer than half an hour. After three hours, 




169/256 


Mom and the Melvins were still screaming along. 
The whole birthing center felt tropically humid, 
even though it was forty degrees outside. 

Henry dropped by. When he came inside and 
heard the noise, he froze in his tracks. I knew that 
the whole kid-thing freaked him out. I’d overheard 
Mom and Dad talking about that, and Henry’s re- 
fusal to grow up. He’d apparently been shocked 
when Mom and Dad had me, and now was com- 
pletely bewildered that they chose to have a second. 
They’d both been relieved when he and Willow had 
gotten back together. “Finally, a grown-up in 
Henry’s life,” Mom had said. 

Henry looked at me; his face was pale and sweaty. 
“Holy shit, Mee. Should you be hearing this? Should 
I be hearing this?” 

I shrugged. Henry sat down next to me. “I’ve got 
the flu or something, but your Dad just called asking 
me to bring some food. So here I am,” he said, prof- 
fering a Taco Bell bag reeking of onions. Mom let 
out another moan. “I should go. Don’t want me 
spreading germs or anything.” Mom screamed even 
louder and Henry practically jumped in his seat. 
“You sure you wanna hang around for this? You can 
come back to my place. Willow’s there, taking care 




170/256 


of me.” He grinned when he mentioned her name. 
“She can take care of you, too.” He stood up to 
leave. 

“No. I’m fine. Mom needs me. Dad’s kind of 
freaking out, though.” 

“Did he puke yet?” Henry asked, sitting back 
down on the couch. I laughed, but then saw from his 
face that he was serious. 

“He threw up when you were coming. Almost 
fainted on the floor. Not that I can blame him. But 
the dude was a mess, the doctors wanted to kick 
him out . . . said they were going to if you didn’t 
come out within a half hour. That got your mom so 
pissed off she pushed you out five minutes later.” 
Henry smiled, leaning back into the sofa. “So the 
story goes. But I’ll tell you this: He cried like a 
motherfucking baby when you were born.” 

“I’ve heard that part.” 

“Heard what part?” Dad asked breathlessly. He 
grabbed the bag from Henry. “Taco Bell, Henry?” 

“Dinner of champions,” Henry said. 

“It’ll do. I’m starving. It’s intense in there. Got to 
keep up my strength.” 




171/256 


Henry winked at me. Dad pulled out a burrito and 
offered one to me. I shook my head. Dad had started 
unwrapping his meal when Mom let out a growl and 
then started screaming at the midwife that she was 
ready to push. 

The midwife poked her head out the door. “I 
think we’re getting close, so maybe you should save 
dinner for later,” she said. “Come on back.” 

Henry practically bolted out the front door. I fol- 
lowed Dad into the bedroom where Mom was sitting 
now, panting like a sick dog. “Would you like to 
watch?” the midwife asked Dad, but he just swayed 
and turned a pale shade of green. 

“I’m probably better up here,” he said, grasping 
Mom’s hand, which she violently shook off. 

No one asked me if I wanted to watch. I just auto- 
matically went to stand next to the midwife. It was 
pretty gross, I’ll admit. Lots of blood. And I’d cer- 
tainly never seen my mom so full-on frontal before. 
But it felt strangely normal for me to be there. The 
midwife was telling Mom to push, then hold, then 
push. “Go baby, go baby, go baby go,” she chanted. 
“You’re almost there!” she cheered. Mom looked 
like she wanted to smack her. 




172/256 


When Teddy slid out, he was head up, facing the 
ceiling, so that the first thing he saw was me. He 
didn’t come out squalling like you see on TV. He 
was just quiet. His eyes were open, staring straight 
at me. He held my gaze as the midwife suctioned 
out his nose. “It’s a boy,” she shouted. 

The midwife put Teddy on Mom’s belly. “Do you 
want to cut the cord?” she asked Dad. Dad waved 
his hands no, too overcome or nauseous to speak. 

“I’ll do it,” I offered. 

The midwife held the cord taut and told me where 
to cut. Teddy lay still, his gray eyes wide open, still 
staring at me. 

Mom always said that it was because Teddy saw 
me first, and because I cut his cord, that somewhere 
deep down he thought I was his mother. “It’s like 
those goslings,” Mom joked. “Imprinting on a zoolo- 
gist, not the mama goose, because he was the first 
one they saw when they hatched.” 

She exaggerated. Teddy didn’t really think I was 
his mother, but there were certain things that only I 
could do for him. When he was a baby and going 
through his nightly fussy period, he’d only calm 
down after I played him a lullaby on my cello. When 




173/256 


he started getting into Harry Potter, only I was al- 
lowed to read a chapter to him every night. And 
when he’d skin a knee or bump his head, if I was 
around he would not stop crying until I bestowed a 
magic kiss on the injury, after which he’d miracu- 
lously recover. 

I know that all the magic kisses in the world prob- 
ably couldn’t have helped him today. But I would do 
anything to have been able to give him one. 


10:40 P.M. 


I run away. 

I leave Adam, Kim, and Willow in the lobby and I 
just start careening through the hospital. I don’t 
realize I’m looking for the pediatric ward until I get 
there. I tear through the halls, past rooms with 
nervous four-year-olds sleeping restlessly before to- 
morrow’s tonsillectomies, past the neonatal ICU 
with babies the size of fists, hooked up to more 
tubes than I am, past the pediatric oncology unit 
where bald cancer patients sleep under cheerful 
murals of rainbows and balloons. I’m looking for 




174/256 


him, even though I know I won’t find him. Still, I 
have to keep looking. 

I picture his head, his tight blond curls. I love to 
nuzzle my face in those curls, have done since he 
was a baby. I kept waiting for the day when he’d 
swat me away, say “You’re embarrassing me,” the 
way he does to Dad when Dad cheers too loudly at 
T-ball games. But so far, that hadn’t happened. So 
far, I’ve been allowed constant access to that head of 
his. So far. Now there is no more so far. It’s over. 

I picture myself nuzzling his head one last time, 
and I can’t even imagine it without seeing myself 
crying, my tears turning his blond curlicues 
straight. 

Teddy is never going to graduate from T-ball to 
baseball. He’s never going to grow a mustache. 
Never going to get into a fistfight or shoot a deer or 
kiss a girl or have sex or fall in love or get married 
or father his own curly-haired child. I’m only ten 
years older than him, but it’s like I’ve already had so 
much more life. It is unfair. If one of us should have 
been left behind, if one of us should be given the op- 
portunity for more life, it should be him. 




175/256 


I race through the hospital like a trapped wild an- 
imal. Teddy? I call. Where are you? Come back to 
me! 

But he won’t. I know it’s fruitless. I give up and 
drag myself back to my ICU. I want to break the 
double doors. I want to smash the nurses’ station. I 
want it all to go away. I want to go away. I don’t 
want to be here. I don’t want to be in this hospital. I 
don’t want to be in this suspended state where I can 
see what’s happening, where I’m aware of what I’m 
feeling without being able to actually feel it. I cannot 
scream until my throat hurts or break a window 
with my fist until my hand bleeds, or pull my hair 
out in clumps until the pain in my scalp overcomes 
the one in my heart. 

I’m staring at myself, at the “live” Mia now, lying 
in her hospital bed. I feel a burst of fury. If I could 
slap my own lifeless face, I would. 

Instead, I sit down in the chair and close my eyes, 
wishing it all away. Except I can’t. I can’t concen- 
trate because there’s suddenly so much noise. My 
monitors are blipping and chirping and two nurses 
are racing toward me. 

“Her BP and pulse ox are dropping,” one yells. 




176/256 


“She’s tachycardic,” the other yells. “What 
happened?” 

“Code blue, code blue in Trauma,” blares the PA. 

Soon the nurses are joined by a bleary-eyed doc- 
tor, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, which are 
ringed by deep circles. He yanks down the covers 
and lifts my hospital gown. I’m naked from the 
waist down, but no one notices these things here. 
He puts his hands on my belly, which is swollen and 
hard. His eyes widen and then narrow into slits. 
“Abdomen’s rigid,” he says angrily. “We need to do 
an ultrasound.” 

Nurse Ramirez runs to a back room and then 
wheels out what looks like a portable laptop with a 
long white attachment. She squirts some jelly on my 
stomach, and the doctor runs the attachment over 
my stomach. 

“Damn. Full of fluid,” he says. “Patient had sur- 
gery this afternoon?” 

“A splenectomy,” Nurse Ramirez replies. 

“Could be a missed blood vessel that wasn’t caut- 
erized,” the doctor says. “Or a slow leak from a per- 
forated bowel. Car accident, right?” 

“Yes. Patient was medevaced in this morning.” 




177/256 


The doctor flips through my chart. “Doctor 
Sorensen was her surgeon. He’s still on call. Page 
him, get her to the OR. We need to get inside and 
find out what’s leaking, and why, before she drops 
any further. Jesus, brain contusions, collapsed lung. 
This kid’s a train wreck.” 

Nurse Ramirez shoots the doctor a dirty look, as if 
he had just insulted me. 

“Miss Ramirez,” the grumpy nurse at the desk 
scolds. “You have patients of your own to deal with. 
Let’s get this young woman intubated and trans- 
ferred to the OR. That will do her more good than 
all this dillydallying around!” 

The nurses work rapidly to detach the monitors 
and catheters and run another tube down my 
throat. A pair of orderlies rush in with a gurney and 
heave me onto it. I’m still naked from the waist 
down as they hustle me out, but right before I reach 
the back door, Nurse Ramirez calls, “Wait!” and 
then gently closes the hospital gown around my 
legs. She taps me three times on the forehead with 
her fingers, like it’s some kind of Morse code mes- 
sage. And then I’m gone into the maze of hallways 
leading toward the OR for another round of cutting, 




178/256 


but this time I don’t follow myself. This time I stay 
behind in the ICU. 

I am starting to get it now. I mean, I don’t totally 
fully understand. It’s not like I somehow com- 
manded a blood vessel to pop open and start leaking 
into my stomach. It’s not like I wished for another 
surgery. But Teddy is gone. Mom and Dad are gone. 
This morning I went for a drive with my family. And 
now I am here, as alone as I’ve ever been. I am sev- 
enteen years old. This is not how it’s supposed to be. 
This is not how my life is supposed to turn out. 

In the quiet corner of the ICU I start to really 
think about the bitter things I’ve managed to ignore 
so far today. What would it be like if I stay? What 
would it feel like to wake up an orphan? To never 
smell Dad smoke a pipe? To never stand next to 
Mom quietly talking as we do the dishes? To never 
read Teddy another chapter of Harry Potter? To 
stay without them? 

I’m not sure this is a world I belong in anymore. 
I’m not sure that I want to wake up. 


179/256 


I’ve only ever been to one funeral in my life and it 
was for someone I hardly knew. 

I might have gone to Great-Aunt Glo’s funeral 
after she died of acute pancreatitis. Except her will 
was very specific about her final wishes. No tradi- 
tional service, no burial in the family plot. Instead, 
she wanted to be cremated and have her ashes 
scattered in a sacred Native American ceremony 
somewhere in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Gran 
was pretty annoyed by that, by Aunt Glo in general, 
who Gran said was always trying to call attention to 
how different she was, even after she was dead. 
Gran ended up boycotting the ash scattering, and if 
she wasn’t going, there was no reason for the rest of 
us to. 

Peter Heilman, my trombonist friend from con- 
servatory camp, he died two years ago, but I didn’t 
find out until I returned to camp and he wasn’t 
there. Few of us had known that he’d had lymph- 
oma. That was the funny thing about conservatory 
camp; you got so close with the people over the 
summer, but it was some unwritten rule that you 
didn’t keep in touch during the rest of the year. We 
were summer friends. Anyhow, we had a memorial 
concert at camp in Peter’s honor, but it wasn’t really 
a funeral. 




180/256 


Kerry Gifford was a musician in town, one of Mom 
and Dad’s people. Unlike Dad and Henry, who as 
they got older and had families became less music 
performers than music connoisseurs, Kerry stayed 
single and stayed faithful to his first love: playing 
music. He was in three bands and he earned his liv- 
ing doing the sound at a local club, an ideal setup 
because at least one of his bands seemed to play 
there every week, so he just had to hop up on the 
stage and let someone take the controls for his set, 
though sometimes you’d see him jumping down in 
the middle of a set to adjust the monitors himself. I 
had known Kerry when I was little and would go to 
shows with Mom and Dad and then I sort of remet 
him when Adam and I got together and I started go- 
ing to shows again. 

He was at work one night, doing the sound for a 
Portland band called Clod, when he just keeled over 
on the soundboard. He was dead by the time the 
ambulance got there. A freak brain aneurysm. 

Kerry’s death caused an uproar in our town. He 
was kind of fixture around here, an outspoken guy 
with a big personality and this mass of wild white- 
boy dreadlocks. And he was young, only thirty-two. 




181/256 


Everyone we knew was planning on going to his fu- 
neral, which was being held in the town where he 
grew up, in the mountains a couple of hours’ drive 
away. Mom and Dad were going, of course, and so 
was Adam. So even though I felt a little bit like an 
impostor crashing someone’s death day, I decided 
to go along. Teddy stayed with Gran and Gramps. 

We caravanned to Kerry’s hometown with a 
bunch of people, squeezing into a car with Henry 
and Willow, who was so pregnant the seat belt 
wouldn’t fit over her bump. Everyone took turns 
telling funny stories about Kerry. Kerry the avowed 
left-winger who decided to protest the Iraq war by 
getting a bunch of guys to dress up in drag and go 
down to the local army recruiting office to enlist. 
Kerry the atheist curmudgeon, who hated how com- 
mercialized Christmas had become and so threw an 
annual Merry Anti-Christmas Celebration at the 
club, where he held a contest for which band could 
play the most distorted versions of Christmas car- 
ols. Then he invited everyone to throw all their 
crappy presents into a big pile in the middle of the 
club. And contrary to local lore, Kerry did not burn 
the stuff in a bonfire; Dad told me that he donated it 
to St. Vincent de Paul. 




182/256 


As everyone talked about Kerry, the mood in the 
car was fizzy and fun, like we were going to the cir- 
cus, not a funeral. But it seemed right, it seemed 
true to Kerry, who was always overflowing with 
frenetic energy. 

The funeral, though, was the opposite. It was hor- 
ribly depressing— and not just because it was for 
someone who’d died tragically young and for no 
particular reason aside from some bad arterial luck. 
It was held in a huge church, which seemed strange 
considering Kerry was an outspoken atheist, but 
that part I could understand. I mean where else do 
you have a funeral? The problem was the service it- 
self. It was obvious that the pastor had never even 
met Kerry because when he talked about him, it was 
generic, about what a kind heart Kerry had and how 
even though it was sad that he was gone, he was get- 
ting his “heavenly reward.” 

And instead of having eulogies from his band- 
mates or the people in town who he’d spent the last 
fifteen years with, some uncle from Boise got up and 
talked about teaching Kerry how to ride a bike when 
he was six, like learning to ride a bike was the defin- 
ing moment in Kerry’s life. He concluded by reas- 
suring us that Kerry was walking with Jesus now. I 
could see my mom getting red when he said that, 




183/256 


and I started to get a little worried that she might 
say something. We went to church sometimes, so 
it’s not like Mom had anything against religion, but 
Kerry totally did and Mom was ferociously protect- 
ive of the people she loved, so much that she took 
insults upon them personally. Her friends some- 
times called her Mama Bear for this reason. Steam 
was practically blowing out of Mom’s ears by the 
time the service ended with a rousing rendition of 
Bette Midler’s “Wind Beneath My Wings.” 

“It’s a good thing Kerry’s dead, because that fu- 
neral would’ve sent him over the edge,” Henry said. 
After the church service, we’d decided to skip the 
formal luncheon and had gone to a diner. 

‘“Wind Beneath My Wings’?” Adam asked, ab- 
sentmindedly taking my hand into his and blowing 
on it, which is what he did to warm my perpetually 
cold fingers. “What’s wrong with ‘Amazing Grace’? 
It’s still traditional—” 

“But doesn’t make you want to puke,” Henry in- 
terjected. “Or better yet, ‘Three Little Birds’ by Bob 
Marley. That would have been a more Kerry-worthy 
song. Something to toast the guy he was.” 

“That funeral wasn’t about celebrating Kerry’s 
life,” Mom growled, yanking at her scarf. “It was 




184/256 


about repudiating it. It was like they killed him all 
over again.” 

Dad put a calming hand over Mom’s clenched fist. 
“Now come on. It was just a song.” 

“It wasn’t just a song,” Mom said, snatching her 
hand away. “It was what it represented. That whole 
charade back there. You of all people should 
understand.” 

Dad shrugged and smiled sadly. “Maybe I should. 
But I can’t be angry with his family. I imagine this 
funeral was their way of reclaiming their son.” 

“Please,” Mom said, shaking her head. “If they 
wanted to claim their son, why didn’t they respect 
the life he chose to live? How come they never came 
to visit? Or supported his music?” 

“We don’t know what they thought about all 
that,” Dad replied. “Let’s not judge too harshly. It 
has to be heart-breaking to bury your child.” 

“I can’t believe you’re making excuses for them,” 
Mom exclaimed. 

“I’m not. I just think you might be reading too 
much into a musical selection.” 




185/256 


“And I think you’re confusing being empathetic 
with being a pushover!” 

Dad’s wince was barely visible, but it was enough 
to make Adam squeeze my hand and Henry and 
Willow exchange a look. Henry jumped in, to Dad’s 
rescue, I think. “It’s different for you, with your par- 
ents,” he told Dad. “I mean they’re old-fashioned 
but they always were into what you did, and even in 
your wildest days, you were always a good son, a 
good father. Always home for Sunday dinner.” 

Mom guffawed, as if Henry’s statement had 
proven her point. We all turned to her, and our 
shocked expressions seemed to snap her out of her 
rant. “Clearly I’m just emotional right now,” she 
said. Dad seemed to understand that was as much 
an apology as he was going to get right now. He 
covered her hand with his and this time she didn’t 
snatch it away. 

Dad paused, hesitating before speaking. “I just 
think that funerals are a lot like death itself. You can 
have your wishes, your plans, but at the end of the 
day, it’s out of your control.” 

“No way,” Henry said. “Not if you make your 
wishes known to the right people.” He turned to 
Willow and spoke to the bump in her belly. “So 




186/256 


listen up, family. At my funeral no one is allowed to 
wear black. And for music, I want something poppy 
and old-school, like Mr. T Experience.” He looked 
up at Willow. “Got that?” 

“Mr. T Experience. I’ll make sure of it.” 

“Thanks, and what about you, honey?” he asked 
her. 

Without missing a beat, Willow said: “Play ‘P.S. 
You Rock My World’ by the Eels. And I want one of 
those green funerals where they bury you in the 
ground under a tree. So the funeral itself would be 
in nature. And no flowers. I mean, give me all the 
peonies you want when I’m alive, but once I’m dead, 
better to give donations on my behalf to a good 
charity like Doctors Without Borders.” 

“You’ve got all the details figured out,” Adam 
said. “Is that a nurse thing?” 

Willow shrugged. 

“According to Kim, that means you’re deep,” I 
said. “She says that the world is divided into the 
people who imagine their own funerals and the 
people who don’t, and that smart and artistic people 
naturally fall into the former category.” 

“So which are you?” Adam asked me. 




187/256 


“I’d want Mozart’s Requiem,” I said. I turned to 
Mom and Dad. “Don’t worry, I’m not suicidal or 
anything.” 

“Please,” Mom said, her mood lightening as she 
stirred her coffee. “When I was growing up I’d have 
elaborate fantasies about my funeral. My deadbeat 
father and all the friends who’d wronged me would 
weep over my casket, which would be red, naturally, 
and they’d play James Taylor.” 

“Let me guess,” Willow said. ‘“Fire and Rain’?” 

Mom nodded and she and Willow started laugh- 
ing and soon everyone at the table was cracking up 
so hard that tears ran down our faces. And then we 
were crying, even me, who didn’t know Kerry all 
that well. Crying and laughing, laughing and crying. 

“So what now?” Adam asked Mom when we’d 
calmed down. “Still harbor a soft spot for Mr. 
Taylor?” 

Mom stopped and blinked hard, which is what 
she does when she’s thinking about something. 
Then she reached over to stroke Dad’s cheek, a rare 
demonstration of PDA. “In my ideal scenario, my 
bighearted pushover husband and I die quickly and 
simultaneously when we’re ninety-two years old. 




188/256 


I’m not sure how. Maybe we’re on a safari in 
Africa— ’cause in the future, we’re rich; hey, it’s my 
fantasy— and we come down with some exotic sick- 
ness and go to sleep one night feeling fine and then 
never wake up. And no James Taylor. Mia plays at 
our funeral. If, that is, we can tear her away from 
the New York Philharmonic.” 


Dad was wrong. It’s true you might not get to con- 
trol your funeral, but sometimes you do get to 
choose your death. And I can’t help thinking that 
part of Mom’s wish did come true. She went with 
Dad. But I won’t be playing at her funeral. It’s pos- 
sible that her funeral will also be mine. There’s 
something comforting in that. To go down as a fam- 
ily. No one left behind. That said, I can’t help think- 
ing Mom would not be happy about this. In fact, 
Mama Bear would be absolutely furious with the 
way events are unfolding today. 


2:48 A.M. 


I’m back where I started. Back in the ICU. My body, 
that is. I’ve been sitting here all along, too tired to 




189/256 


move. I wish I could go to sleep. I wish there was 
some kind of anesthesia for me, or at least 
something to make the world shut up. I want to be 
like my body, quiet and lifeless, putty in someone 
else’s hands. I don’t have the energy for this de- 
cision. I don’t want this anymore. I say it out loud. I 
don’t want this. I look around the ICU, feeling kind 
of ridiculous. I doubt all the other messed-up people 
in the ward are exactly thrilled to be here, either. 

My body wasn’t gone from the ICU for too long. A 
few hours for surgery. Some time in the recovery 
room. I don’t know exactly what’s happened to me, 
and for the first time today, I don’t really care. I 
shouldn’t have to care. I shouldn’t have to work this 
hard. I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard. 

I’m back on the ventilator, and once again there’s 
tape over my eyes. I still don’t understand the tape. 
Are the doctors afraid that I’ll wake up mid-surgery 
and be horrified by the scalpels or blood? As if those 
things could faze me now. Two nurses, the one as- 
signed to me and Nurse Ramirez, come over to my 
bed and check all my monitors. They call out a chor- 
us of numbers that are as familiar to me now as my 
own name: BP, pulse ox, respiratory rate. Nurse 
Ramirez looks like an entirely different person from 
the one who arrived here yesterday afternoon. The 




190/256 


makeup has all rubbed off and her hair is flat. She 
looks like she could sleep standing up. Her shift 
must be over soon. I’ll miss her but I’m glad she’ll 
be able to get away from me, from this place. I’d like 
to get away, too. I think I will. I think it’s just a mat- 
ter of time— of figuring out how to let go. 

I haven’t been back in my bed fifteen minutes 
when Willow shows up. She marches through the 
double doors and goes to speak to the one nurse be- 
hind the desk. I don’t hear what she says, but I hear 
her tone: it’s polite, soft-spoken, but leaving no 
room for questions. When she leaves the room a few 
minutes later, there’s a change in the air. Willow’s 
in charge now. The grumpy nurse at first looks 
pissed off, like Who is this woman to tell me what 
to do? But then she seems to resign, to throw her 
hands up in surrender. It’s been a crazy night. The 
shift is almost over. Why bother? Soon, me and all 
of my noisy, pushy visitors will be somebody else’s 
problem. 

Five minutes later, Willow is back, bringing Gran 
and Gramps with her. Willow has worked all day 
and now she is here all night. I know she doesn’t get 
enough sleep on a good day. I used to hear Mom 
give her tips for getting the baby to sleep through 
the night. 




191/256 


I’m not sure who looks worse, me or Gramps. His 
cheeks are sallow, his skin looks gray and papery, 
and his eyes are bloodshot. Gran, on the other hand, 
looks just like Gran. No sign of wear and tear on 
her. It’s like exhaustion wouldn’t dare mess with 
her. She bustles right over to my bed. 

“You’ve sure got us on a roller-coaster ride today,” 
Gran says lightly. “Your mom always said she 
couldn’t believe what an easy girl you were and I re- 
member telling her, ‘Just wait until she hits pu- 
berty.’ But you proved me wrong. Even then you 
were such a breeze. Never gave us any trouble. 
Never the kind of girl to make my heart race in fear. 
You made up for a lifetime of that today.” 

“Now, now,” Gramps says, putting a hand on her 
shoulder. 

“Oh, I’m only kidding. Mia would appreciate it. 
She’s got a sense of humor, no matter how serious 
she sometimes seems. A wicked sense of humor, 
this one.” 

Gran pulls the chair up next to my bed and starts 
combing through my hair with her fingers. Someone 
has rinsed it out, so, while it’s not exactly clean, it’s 
not caked with blood, either. Gran starts untangling 
my bangs, which are about chin length. I’m forever 




192/256 


cutting bangs, then growing them. It’s about as rad- 
ical a makeover as I can give myself. She works her 
way down, pulling the hair out from under the pil- 
low so it streams down my chest, hiding some of the 
lines and tubes connected to me. “There, much bet- 
ter,” she says. “You know, I went outside for a walk 
today and you’ll never guess what I saw. A crossbill. 
In Portland in February. Now, that’s unusual. I 
think it’s Glo. She always had a soft spot for you. 
Said you reminded her of your father, and she ad- 
ored him. When he cut his first crazy Mohawk 
hairdo, she practically threw him a party. She loved 
that he was rebellious, so different. Little did she 
know your father couldn’t stand her. She came to 
visit us once when your dad was around five or six, 
and she had this ratty mink coat with her. This was 
before she got all into the animal rights and crystals 
and the like. The coat smelled terrible, like moth- 
balls, like the old linens we kept in a trunk in the at- 
tic, and your father took to calling her ‘Auntie Trunk 
Smell.’ She never knew that. But she loved that he’d 
rebelled against us, or so she thought, and she 
thought it was something that you rebelled all over 
again by becoming a classical musician. Though 
much as I tried to tell her that it wasn’t the way it 




193/256 


was, she didn’t care. She had her own ideas about 
things; I suppose we all do.” 

Gran twitters on for another five minutes, filling 
me in on mundane news: Heather has decided she 
wants to become a librarian. My cousin Matthew 
bought a motorcycle and my aunt Patricia is not 
pleased about that. I’ve heard her keep up a running 
stream of commentary like this for hours while she’s 
cooking dinner or potting orchids. And listening to 
her now, I can almost picture us in her greenhouse, 
where even in winter, the air is always warm and 
humid and smells musty and earthy like soil with 
the slightest tinge of manure. Gran hand-collects 
cowshit, “cow patties,” she calls them, and mixes 
them in with mulch to make her own fertilizer. 
Gramps thinks she should patent the recipe and sell 
it because she uses it on her orchids, which are al- 
ways winning awards. 

I try to meditate on the sound of Gran’s voice, to 
be carried away by her happy babble. Sometimes I 
can almost fall asleep while sitting on the bar stool 
at her kitchen counter and listening to her, and I 
wonder if I could do that here today. Sleep would be 
so welcome. A warm blanket of black to erase 
everything else. Sleep without dreams. I’ve heard 
people talk about the sleep of the dead. Is that what 




194/256 


death would feel like? The nicest, warmest, heaviest 
never-ending nap? If that’s what it’s like, I wouldn’t 
mind. If that’s what dying is like, I wouldn’t mind 
that at all. 

I jerk myself up, a panic destroying whatever 
calm listening to Gran had offered. I am still not en- 
tirely clear on the particulars here, but I do know 
that once I fully commit to going, I’ll go. But I’m not 
ready. Not yet. I don’t know why, but I’m not. And 
I’m a little scared that if I accidentally think, I 
wouldn’t mind an endless nap, it will happen and 
be irreversible, like the way my grandparents used 
to warn me that if I made a funny face as the clock 
struck noon, it would remain like that forever. 

I wonder if every dying person gets to decide 
whether they stay or go. It seems unlikely. After all, 
this hospital is full of people having poisonous 
chemicals pumped into their veins or submitting to 
horrible operations all so they can stay, but some of 
them will die anyway. 

Did Mom and Dad decide? It hardly seems like 
there would have been time for them to make such a 
momentous decision, and I can’t imagine them 
choosing to leave me behind. And what about 
Teddy? Did he want to go with Mom and Dad? Did 




195/256 


he know that I was still here? Even if he did, I 
wouldn’t blame him for choosing to go without me. 
He’s little. He was probably scared. I suddenly pic- 
ture him alone and frightened, and for the first time 
in my life, I hope that Gran is right about the angels. 
I pray they were all too busy comforting Teddy to 
worry about me. 

Why can’t someone else decide this for me? Why 
can’t I get a death proxy? Or do what baseball teams 
do when it’s late in the game and they need a solid 
batter to bring the guys on base home? Can’t I have 
a pinch hitter to take me home? 


Gran is gone. Willow is gone. The ICU is tranquil. I 
close my eyes. When I open them again, Gramps is 
there. He’s crying. He’s not making any noise, but 
tears are cascading down his cheeks, wetting his en- 
tire face. I’ve never seen anyone cry like this. Quiet 
but gushing, a faucet behind his eyes mysteriously 
turned on. The tears fall onto my blanket, onto my 
freshly combed hair. Plink. Plink. Plink. 

Gramps doesn’t wipe his face or blow his nose. He 
just lets the tears fall where they may. And when the 
well of grief is momentarily dry, he steps forward 
and kisses me on the forehead. He looks like he’s 




196/256 


about to leave, but then he doubles back to my bed- 
side, bends so his face is level with my ear, and 
whispers into it. 

“It’s okay,” he tells me. “If you want to go. Every- 
one wants you to stay. I want you to stay more than 
I’ve ever wanted anything in my life.” His voice 
cracks with emotion. He stops, clears his throat, 
takes a breath, and continues. “But that’s what I 
want and I could see why it might not be what you 
want. So I just wanted to tell you that I understand 
if you go. It’s okay if you have to leave us. It’s okay if 
you want to stop fighting.” 

For the first time since I realized that Teddy was 
gone, too, I feel something unclench. I feel myself 
breathe. I know that Gramps can’t be that late-in- 
ning pinch hitter I’d hoped for. He won’t unplug my 
breathing tube or overdose me with morphine or 
anything like that. But this is the first time today 
that anyone has acknowledged what I have lost. I 
know that the social worker warned Gran and 
Gramps not to upset me, but Gramps’s recognition, 
and the permission he just offered me— it feels like a 
gift. 

Gramps doesn’t leave me. He slumps back into 
the chair. It’s quiet now. So quiet that you can 




197/256 


almost hear other people’s dreams. So quiet that 
you can almost hear me tell Gramps, “Thank you.” 


When Mom had Teddy, Dad was still playing drums 
in the same band he’d been in since college. They’d 
released a couple of CDs; they’d gone on a tour 
every summer. The band was by no means big, but 
they had a following in the Northwest and in vari- 
ous college towns between here and Chicago. And, 
weirdly, they had a bunch of fans in Japan. The 
band was always getting letters from Japanese teen- 
agers begging them to come play, and offering up 
their homes as crash pads. Dad was always saying 
that if they went, he’d take me and Mom. Mom and 
I even learned a few words of Japanese just in case. 
Konnichiwa. Arigatou. It never panned out, 
though. 

After Mom announced she was pregnant with 
Teddy, the first sign that changes were afoot was 
when Dad went and got himself a learner’s permit. 
At age thirty-three. He tried letting Mom teach him 
to drive, but she was too impatient, he said. Dad 
was too sensitive to criticism, Mom said. So Gramps 


198/256 


took Dad out along the empty country lanes in his 
pickup truck, just like he’d done with the rest of 
Dad’s siblings— except they’d all learned to drive 
when they were sixteen. 

Next up was the wardrobe change, but it wasn’t 
something any of us noticed right away. It wasn’t 
like one day he stripped off the tight black jeans and 
band tees in exchange for suits. It was more subtle. 
First the band tees went out in the window in favor 
of button-up 1950s rayon numbers, which he dug 
up at the Goodwill until they started getting trendy 
and he had to buy them from the fancy vintage- 
clothing shop. Then the jeans went in the bin, ex- 
cept for one pair of impeccable, dark blue Levi’s, 
which Dad ironed and wore on weekends. Most 
days he wore neat, flat-front cuffed trousers. But 
when, a few weeks after Teddy was born, Dad gave 
away his leather jacket— his prized beat-up motor- 
cycle jacket with the fuzzy leopard belt— we finally 
realized that a major transformation was under 
way. 

“Dude, you cannot be serious,” Henry said when 
Dad handed him the jacket. “You’ve been wearing 
this thing since you were a kid. It even smells like 
you.” 




199/256 


Dad shrugged, ending the conversation. Then he 
went to pick up Teddy, who was squalling from his 
bassinet. 


A few months later, Dad announced he was leaving 
the band. Mom told him not to do it for her sake. 
She said it was okay to keep playing as long as he 
didn’t take off on monthlong tours, leaving her 
alone with two kids. Dad said not to worry, he 
wasn’t quitting for her. 

Dad’s other bandmates took his decision in stride, 
but Henry was devastated. He tried to talk him out 
of it. Promised they’d only play in town. Wouldn’t 
have to tour. Ever be gone overnight. “We can even 
start playing shows in suits. We’ll look like the Rat 
Pack. Do Sinatra covers. Come on, man,” Henry 
reasoned. 

When Dad refused to reconsider, he and Henry 
had a huge blowout. Henry was furious with Dad for 
unilaterally quitting the band, especially since Mom 
had said he could still play shows. Dad told Henry 
that he was sorry, but he’d made his decision. By 
this time, he’d already filled out his applications for 
grad school. He was going to be a teacher now. No 




200/256 


more dicking around. “One day you’ll understand,” 
Dad told Henry. 

“The fuck I will,” Henry shot back. 

Henry didn’t speak to Dad for a few months after 
that. Willow would drop by from time to time, to 
play peace-maker. She’d explain to Dad that Henry 
was just sorting some stuff out. “Give him time,” she 
said, and Dad would pretend to not be hurt. Then 
she and Mom would drink coffee in the kitchen and 
exchange knowing smiles that seemed to say: Men 
are such boys. 

Henry eventually resurfaced, but he didn’t apolo- 
gize to Dad, not right away, anyhow. Years later, 
shortly after his daughter was born, Henry called 
our house one night in tears. “I get it now,” he told 
Dad. 


Strangely enough, in some ways Gramps seemed as 
upset with Dad’s metamorphosis as Henry had 
been. You would have thought he would love the 
new Dad. On the surface, he and Gran seem so old- 
school, it’s like a time warp. They don’t use com- 
puters or watch cable TV, and they never curse and 
have this thing about them that makes you want to 
be polite. Mom, who swore like a prison guard, 




201/256 


never cursed around Gran and Gramps. It was like 
no one wanted to disappoint them. 

Gran got a kick out of Dad’s stylistic transforma- 
tion. “Had I known that all that stuff was going to 
come back in style, I would’ve saved Gramps’s old 
suits,” Gran said one Sunday afternoon when we’d 
stopped by for lunch and Dad pulled off a trench 
coat to reveal a pair of wool gabardine trousers and 
a 1950s cardigan. 

“It hasn’t come back into style. Punk has come in- 
to style, so I think this is your son’s way of rebelling 
all over again,” Mom said with a smirk. “Whose 
daddy’s a rebel? Is your daddy a rebel?” Mom baby- 
talked as Teddy gurgled in delight. 

“Well, he sure does look dapper,” Gran said. 
“Don’t you think?” she said, turning to Gramps. 

Gramps shrugged. “He always looks good to me. 
All my children and grandchildren do.” But he 
looked pained as he said it. 


Later that afternoon, I went outside with Gramps to 
help him collect firewood. He needed to split some 
more logs, so I watched him take an ax to a bunch of 
dried alder. 




202/256 


“Gramps, don’t you like Dad’s new clothes?” I 
asked. 

Gramps halted the ax in midair. Then he set it 
down gently next to the bench I was sitting on. “I 
like his clothes just fine, Mia,” he said. 

“But you looked so sad in there when Gran was 
talking about it.” 

Gramps shook his head. “Don’t miss a thing, do 
you? Even at ten years old.” 

“It’s not easy to miss. When you feel sad, you look 
sad.” 

“I’m not sad. Your father seems happy and I think 
he’ll make a good teacher. Those are some lucky 
kids who get to read The Great Gatsby with your 
dad. I’ll just miss the music.” 

“Music? You never go to Dad’s shows.” 

“I’ve got bad ears. From the war. The noise 
hurts.” 

“You should wear headphones. Mom makes me 
do that. Earplugs just fall out.” 

“Maybe I’ll try that. But I’ve always listened to 
your dad’s music. At low volume. I’ll admit, I don’t 
much care for all that electric guitar. Not my cup of 




203/256 


tea. But I still admired the music. The words, espe- 
cially. When he was about your age, your father 
used to come up with these great stories. He’d sit 
down at his little table and write them down, then 
give them to Gran to type up, then he’d draw pic- 
tures. Funny stories about animals, but real and 
smart. Always reminded me of that book about the 
spider and the pig— what’s it called?” 

“Charlotte’s Web?” 

“That’s the one. I always thought your dad would 
grow up to be a writer. And in a way, I always felt 
like he did. The words he writes to his music, they’re 
poetry. You ever listen carefully to the things he 
says?” 

I shook my head, suddenly ashamed. I hadn’t 
even realized that Dad wrote lyrics. He didn’t sing 
so I just assumed that the people in front of the mi- 
crophones wrote the words. But I had seen him sit 
at the kitchen table with a guitar and a notepad a 
hundred times. I’d just never put it together. 


That night when we got home, I went up to my 
room with Dad’s CDs and a Discman. I checked the 
liner notes to see which songs Dad had written and 
then I painstakingly copied down all the lyrics. It 




204/256 


was only after I saw them scrawled in my science 
lab book that I saw what Gramps meant. Dad’s lyr- 
ics were not just rhymes. They were something else. 
There was one song in particular called “Waiting for 
Vengeance” that I listened to and read over and over 
until I had it memorized. It was on the second al- 
bum, and it was the only slow song they ever did; it 
sounded almost country, probably from Henry’s 
brief infatuation with hillbilly punk. I listened to it 
so much that I started singing it to myself without 
even realizing it. 

Well, what is this? 

What am I coming to? 

And beyond that, what am I gonna do? 

Now there’s blankness 
Where once your eyes held the light 
But that was so long ago 
That was last night 


Well, what was that? 

What’s that sound that I hear? 

It’s just my lifetime 
It’s whistling past my ear 
And when I look back 
Everything seems smaller than life 




205/256 


The way it’s been for so long 
Since last night 

Now I’m leaving 
Any moment I’ll be gone 
I think you’ll notice 

I think you’ll wonder what went wrong 

I’m not choosing 

But I’m running out of fight 

And this was decided so long ago 

It was last night 

“What are you singing, Mia?” Dad asked me, 
catching me serenading Teddy as I pushed him 
around the kitchen in his stroller in a vain attempt 
to get him to nap. 

“Your song,” I said sheepishly, suddenly feeling 
like I’d maybe illegally trespassed into Dad’s private 
territory. Was it wrong to go around singing other 
people’s music without their permission? 

But Dad looked delighted. “My Mia’s singing 
‘Waiting for Vengeance’ to my Teddy. What do you 
think about that?” He leaned over to muss my hair 
and to tickle Teddy on his chubby cheek. “Well, 
don’t let me stop you. Keep going. I’ll take over this 
part,” he said, taking the stroller. 




206/256 


I felt embarrassed to sing in front of him now, so 
I just sort of mumbled along, but then Dad joined in 
and we sang softly together until Teddy fell asleep. 
Then he put a finger over his lips and gestured for 
me to follow him into the living room. 

“Want to play some chess?” he asked. He was al- 
ways trying to teach me to play, but I thought it was 
too much work for a supposed game. 

“How about checkers?” I asked. 

“Sure.” 

We played in silence. When it was Dad’s move, I’d 
steal looks at him in his button-down shirt, trying to 
remember the fast-fading picture of the guy with 
peroxided hair and a leather jacket. 

“Dad?” 

“Hmm.” 

“Can I ask you a question?” 

“Always.” 

“Are you sad that you aren’t in a band anymore?” 

“Nope,” he said. 

“Not even a little bit?” 




207/256 


Dad’s gray eyes met mine. “What brought this all 
on?” 

“I was talking to Gramps.” 

“Oh, I see.” 

“You do?” 

Dad nodded. “Gramps thinks that he somehow 
exerted pressure on me to change my life.” 

“Well, did he?” 

“I suppose in an indirect way he did. By being 
who he is, by showing me what a father is.” 

“But you were a good dad when you played in a 
band. The best dad. I wouldn’t want you to give that 
up for me,” I said, feeling suddenly choked up. “And 
I don’t think Teddy would, either.” 

Dad smiled and patted my hand. “Mia Oh-My- 
Uh. I’m not giving anything up. It’s not an either-or 
proposition. Teaching or music. Jeans or suits. 
Music will always be a part of my life.” 

“But you quit the band! Gave up dressing punk!” 

Dad sighed. “It wasn’t hard to do. I’d played that 
part of my life out. It was time. I didn’t even think 
twice about it, in spite of what Gramps or Henry 




208/256 


might think. Sometimes you make choices in life 
and sometimes choices make you. Does that make 
any sense?” 

I thought about the cello. How sometimes I didn’t 
understand why I’d been drawn to it, how some 
days it seemed as if the instrument had chosen me. I 
nodded, smiled, and returned my attention to the 
game. “King me,” I said. 


4:57 A.M. 

I can’t stop thinking about “Waiting for Vengeance.” 
It’s been years since I’ve listened to or thought of 
that song, but after Gramps left my bedside, I’ve 
been singing it to myself over and over. Dad wrote 
the song ages ago, but now it feels like he wrote it 
yesterday. Like he wrote it from wherever he is. Like 
there’s a secret message in it for me. How else to ex- 
plain those lyrics? I’m not choosing. But I’m run- 
ning out of fight. 

What does it mean? Is it supposed to be some 
kind of instruction? Some clue about what my par- 
ents would choose for me if they could? I try to 
think about it from their perspectives. I know they’d 




209/256 


want to be with me, for us all to be together again 
eventually. But I have no idea if that even happens 
after you die, and if it does, it’ll happen whether I go 
this morning or in seventy years. What would they 
want for me now? As soon as I pose the question, I 
can see Mom’s pissed-off expression. She’d be livid 
with me for even contemplating anything but stay- 
ing. But Dad, he understood what it meant to run 
out of fight. Maybe, like Gramps, he’d understand 
why I don’t think I can stay. 

I’m singing the song, as if buried within its lyrics 
are instructions, a musical road map to where I’m 
supposed to go and how to get there. 

I’m singing and concentrating and singing and 
thinking so hard that I barely register Willow’s re- 
turn to the ICU, barely notice that she’s talking to 
the grumpy nurse, barely recognize the steely de- 
termination in her tone. 

Had I been paying attention, I might have real- 
ized that Willow was lobbying for Adam to be able 
to visit me. Had I been paying attention, I might 
have somehow got away before Willow was— as al- 
ways— successful. 

I don’t want to see him now. I mean, of course I 
do. I ache to. But I know that if I see him, I’m going 




210/256 


to lose the last wisp of peacefulness that Gramps 
gave me when he told me that it was okay to go. I’m 
trying to summon the courage to do what I have to 
do. And Adam will complicate things. I try to stand 
up to get away, but something has happened to me 
since I went back into surgery. I no longer have the 
strength to move. It takes all my effort to sit upright 
in my chair. I can’t run away; all I can do is hide. I 
curl my knees into my chest and close my eyes. 

I hear Nurse Ramirez talking to Willow. “I’ll take 
him over,” she says. And for once, the grumpy nurse 
doesn’t order her back to her own patients. 

“That was a pretty boneheaded move you pulled 
earlier,” I hear her tell Adam. 

“I know,” Adam answers. His voice is a throaty 
whisper, the way it gets after a particularly scream-y 
concert. “I was desperate.” 

“No, you were romantic,” she tells him. 

“I was idiotic. They said she was doing better be- 
fore. That she’d come off the ventilator. That she 
was getting stronger. But after I came in here that 
she got worse. They said her heart stopped on the 
operating table . . .” Adam trails off. 




211/256 


“And they got it started. She had a perforated 
bowel that was slowly leaking bile into her abdomen 
and it threw her organs out of whack. This kind of 
thing happens all the time, and it had nothing to do 
with you. We caught it and fixed it and that’s what 
matters.” 

“But she was doing better,” Adam whispers. He 
sounds so young and vulnerable, like Teddy used to 
sound when he got the stomach flu. “And then I 
came in and she almost died.” His voice chokes into 
a sob. The sound of it wakes me up like a bucket of 
ice water dropped down my shirt. Adam thinks that 
he did this to me? No! That’s beyond absurd. He’s 
so wrong. 

“And I almost stayed in Puerto Rico to marry a fat 
SOB,” the nurse snaps. “But I di’int. And I have a 
different life now. Almost don’t matter. You got to 
deal with the situation at hand. And she’s still here.” 
She whips the privacy curtain around my bed. “In 
you go,” she tells Adam. 

I force my head up and my eyes open. Adam. God, 
even in this state, he is beautiful. His eyes are dip- 
ping with fatigue. He’s sprouting stubble, enough of 
it that if we were to make out, it would make my 
chin raw. He is wearing his typical band uniform of 




212/256 


a T-shirt, skinny pegged pants, and Converse, with 
Gramps’s plaid scarf draped over his shoulders. 

When he first sees me, he blanches, like I’m some 
hideous Creature from the Black Lagoon. I do look 
pretty bad, hooked back up to the ventilator and a 
dozen other tubes, the dressing from my latest sur- 
gery seeping blood. But after a moment, Adam ex- 
hales loudly and then he’s just Adam again. He 
searches around, like he’s dropped something and 
then finds what he’s looking for: my hand. 

“Jesus, Mia, your hands are freezing.” He squats 
down, takes my right hand into his, and careful to 
not bump into my tubes and wires, draws his mouth 
to them, blowing warm air into the shelter he’s cre- 
ated. “You and your crazy hands.” Adam is always 
amazed at how even in middle of summer, even 
after the sweatiest of encounters, my hands stay 
cold. I tell him it’s bad circulation but he doesn’t 
buy it because my feet are usually warm. He says I 
have bionic hands, that this is why I’m such a good 
cello player. 

I watch him warm my hands as he has done a 
thousand times before. I think of the first time he 
did it, at school, sitting on the lawn, as if it were the 
most natural thing in the world. I also remember 




213/256 


the first time he did it in front of my parents. We 
were all sitting on the porch on Christmas Eve, 
drinking cider. It was freezing outside. Adam 
grabbed my hands and blew on them. Teddy 
giggled. Mom and Dad didn’t say anything, just ex- 
changed a quick look, something private that passed 
between them and then Mom smiled ruefully at us. 

I wonder if I tried, if I could feel him touching me. 
If I were to lie down on top of myself in the bed, 
would I become one with my body again? Would I 
feel him then? If I reached out my ghostly hand to 
his, would he feel me? Would he warm the hands he 
cannot see? 

Adam drops my hand and steps forward to look at 
me. He is standing so close that I can almost smell 
him and I’m overpowered by the need to touch him. 
It’s basic, primal, and all-consuming the way a baby 
needs its mother’s breast. Even though I know, if we 
touch, a new tug-of-war— one that will be even more 
painful than the quiet one Adam and I have been 
waging these past few months— will begin. 

Adam is mumbling something now. In a low 
voice. Over and over he is saying: please. Please. 
Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. 
Please. Please. Finally, he stops and looks at my 




214/256 


face. “Please, Mia,” he implores. “Don’t make me 
write a song.” 


I’d never expected to fall in love. I was never the 
kind of girl who had crushes on rock stars or fantas- 
ies about marrying Brad Pitt. I sort of vaguely knew 
that one day I’d probably have boyfriends (in col- 
lege, if Kim’s prediction was anything to go by) and 
get married. I wasn’t totally immune to the charms 
of the opposite sex, but I wasn’t one of those ro- 
mantic, swoony girls who had pink fluffy daydreams 
about falling in love. 

Even as I was falling in love— full throttle, intense, 
can’t-erase-that-goofy-smile love— I didn’t really re- 
gister what was happening. When I was with Adam, 
at least after those first few awkward weeks, I felt so 
good that I didn’t bother thinking about what was 
going on with me, with us. It just felt normal and 
right, like slipping into a hot bubble bath. Which 
isn’t to say we didn’t fight. We argued over lots of 
stuff: him not being nice enough to Kim, me being 
antisocial at shows, how fast he drove, how I stole 
the covers. I got upset because he never wrote any 


215/256 


songs about me. He claimed he wasn’t good with 
sappy love songs: “If you want a song, you’ll have to 
cheat on me or something,” he said, knowing full 
well that wasn’t going to happen. 


This past fall, though, Adam and I started to have a 
different kind of fight. It wasn’t even a fight, really. 
We didn’t shout. We barely even argued, but a 
snake of tension quietly slithered into our lives. And 
it seemed like it all started with my Juilliard 
audition. 

“So did you knock them dead?” Adam asked me 
when I got back. “They gonna let you in with a full 
scholarship?” 

I had a feeling that they were going to let me in, at 
least— even before I told Professor Christie about 
the one judge’s “long time since we’ve had an Ore- 
gon country girl” comment, even before she hyper- 
ventilated because she was so convinced this was a 
tacit promise of admission. Something had 
happened to my playing in that audition; I had 
broken through some invisible barrier and could fi- 
nally play the pieces like I heard them being played 




216/256 


in my head, and the result had been something 
transcendent: the mental and physical, the technical 
and emotional sides of my abilities all finally blend- 
ing. Then, on the drive home, as Gramps and I were 
approaching the California-Oregon border, I just 
had this sudden flash— a vision of me lugging a cello 
through New York City. And it was like I knew, and 
that certainty planted itself in my belly like a warm 
secret. I’m not the kind of person who’s prone to 
premonitions or overconfidence, so I suspected that 
there was more to my flash than magical thinking. 

“I did okay,” I told Adam, and as I said it, I real- 
ized that I’d just straight-out lied to him for the first 
time, and that this was different from all the lying 
by omission I’d been doing before. 

I had neglected to tell Adam that I was applying 
to Juilliard in the first place, which was actually 
harder than it sounded. Before I sent in my applica- 
tion, I had to practice every spare moment with Pro- 
fessor Christie to fine-tune the Shostakovich con- 
certo and the two Bach suites. When Adam asked 
me why I was so busy, I gave purposely vague ex- 
cuses about learning tough new pieces. I justified 
this to myself because it was technically true. And 
then Professor Christie arranged for me to have a 
recording session at the university so I could submit 




217/256 


a high-quality CD to Juilliard. I had to be at the stu- 
dio at seven in the morning on a Sunday and the 
night before I’d pretended to be feeling out of sorts 
and told Adam he probably shouldn’t stay over. I’d 
justified that fib, too. I was feeling out of sorts be- 
cause I was so nervous. So, it wasn’t a real lie. And 
besides, I thought, there was no point in making a 
big fuss about it. I hadn’t told Kim, either, so it 
wasn’t like Adam was getting special deception 
treatment. 

But after I told him I’d only done okay at the au- 
dition, I had the feeling that I was wading into 
quicksand, and that if I took one more step, there’d 
be no extricating myself and I’d sink until I suffoc- 
ated. So I took a deep breath and heaved myself 
back onto solid ground. “Actually, that’s not true,” I 
told Adam. “I did really well. I played better than I 
ever have in my life. It was like I was possessed.” 

Adam’s first reaction was to smile with pride. “I 
wish I could’ve seen that.” But then his eyes clouded 
over and his lips fell into a frown. “Why’d you 
downplay it?” he asked. “Why didn’t you call me 
after the audition to brag?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. 




218/256 


“Well, this is great news,” Adam said, trying to 
mask his hurt. “We should be celebrating.” 

“Okay, let’s celebrate,” I said, with a forced gaiety. 
“We can go to Portland Saturday. Go to the Japan- 
ese Gardens and go out for dinner at Beau Thai.” 

Adam grimaced. “I can’t. We’re playing in 
Olympia and Seattle this weekend. Minitour. Re- 
member? I’d love for you to come, but I don’t know 
if that’s really a celebration for you. But I’ll be back 
Sunday late afternoon. I can meet you in Portland 
Sunday night if you want.” 

“I can’t. I’m playing in a string quartet at some 
professor’s house. What about next weekend?” 

Adam looked pained. “We’re in the studio the 
next couple weekends, but we can go out during the 
week somewhere. Around here. To the Mexican 
place?” 

“Sure. The Mexican place,” I said. 

Two minutes before, I hadn’t even wanted to cel- 
ebrate, but now I was feeling dejected and insulted 
at being relegated to a midweek dinner at the same 
place we always went to. 

When Adam graduated from high school last 
spring and moved out of his parents’ place and into 




219/256 


the House of Rock, I hadn’t expected much to 
change. He’d still live nearby. We’d still see each 
other all the time. I’d miss our little powwows in the 
music wing, but I would also be relieved to have our 
relationship out from under the microscope of high 
school. 

But things had changed when Adam moved into 
the House of Rock and started college, though not 
for the reasons I’d thought they would. At the begin- 
ning of the fall, just as Adam was getting used to 
college life, things suddenly started heating up with 
Shooting Star. The band was offered a record deal 
with a medium-size label based in Seattle and now 
were busy in the studio recording. They were also 
playing more shows, to larger and larger crowds, al- 
most every weekend. Things were so hectic that 
Adam had dropped half his course load and was go- 
ing to college part-time, and if things kept up at this 
rate, he was thinking of dropping out altogether. 
“There are no second chances,” he told me. 

I was genuinely excited for him. I knew that 
Shooting Star was something special, more than just 
a college-town band. I hadn’t minded Adam’s in- 
creasing absences, especially since he made it so 
clear how much he minded them. But somehow, the 
prospect of Juilliard made things 




220/256 


different— somehow it made me mind. Which didn’t 
make any sense at all because if anything, it should 
have leveled the field. Now I had something exciting 
happening, too. 

“We can go to Portland in a few weeks,” Adam 
promised. “When all the holiday lights are up.” 

“Okay,” I said sullenly. 

Adam sighed. “Things are getting complicated, 
aren’t they?” 

“Yeah. Our schedules are too busy,” I said. 

“That’s not what I meant,” Adam said, turning my 
face toward his so I was looking at him in the eye. 

“I know that’s not what you meant,” I replied, but 
then a lump lodged itself in my throat and I couldn’t 
talk anymore. 


We tried to defuse the tension, to talk about it 
without really talking about it, to joke-ify it. “You 
know I read in US News and World Report that 
Willamette University has a good music program,” 
Adam told me. “It’s in Salem, which is apparently 
getting hipper by the moment.” 

“According to who? The governor?” I replied. 




221/256 


“Liz found some good stuff at a vintage-clothing 
store there. And you know, once the vintage places 
come in, the hipsters aren’t far behind.” 

“You forget, I’m not a hipster,” I reminded him. 
“But speaking of, maybe Shooting Star should move 
to New York. I mean, it’s the heart of the punk 
scene. The Ramones. Blondie.” My tone was frothy 
and flirtatious, an Oscar-worthy performance. 

“That was thirty years ago,” Adam said. “And 
even if I wanted to move to New York, there’s no 
way the rest of the band would.” He stared mourn- 
fully at his shoes and I recognized the joking part of 
the conversation had ended. My stomach lurched, 
an appetizer before the full portion of heartache I 
had a feeling was going to be served at some point 
soon. 

Adam and I had never been the kind of couple to 
talk about the future, about where our relationship 
was going, but with things suddenly so unclear, we 
avoided talking about anything that was happening 
more than a few weeks away, and this made our 
conversations as stilted and awkward as they’d been 
in those early weeks together before we’d found our 
groove. One afternoon in the fall, I spotted a beauti- 
ful 1930s silk gown in the vintage store where Dad 




222/256 


bought his suits and I almost pointed it out to Adam 
and asked if he thought I should wear that to the 
prom, but prom was in June and maybe Adam 
would be on tour in June or maybe I’d be too busy 
getting ready for Juilliard, so I didn’t say anything. 
Not long after that, Adam was complaining about 
his decrepit guitar, saying he wanted to get a vintage 
Gibson SG, and I offered to get it for him for his 
birthday. But then he said that those guitars cost 
thousands of dollars, and besides his birthday 
wasn’t until September, and the way he said 
September, it was like a judge issuing a prison 
sentence. 


A few weeks ago, we went to a New Year’s Eve party 
together. Adam got drunk, and when midnight 
came, he kissed me hard. “Promise me. Promise me 
you’ll spend New Year’s with me next year,” he 
whispered into my ear. 




I was about to explain that even if I did go to Juil- 
liard, I’d be home for Christmas and New Year’s, 
but then I realized that wasn’t the point. So I prom- 
ised him because I wanted it to be true as much as 
he did. And I kissed him back so hard, like I was try- 
ing to merge our bodies through our lips. 

On New Year’s Day, I came home to find the rest 
of my family gathered in the kitchen with Henry, 
Willow, and the baby. Dad was making breakfast: 
smoked-salmon hash, his specialty. 

Henry shook his head when he saw me. “Look at 
the kids today. Seems like just yesterday that stum- 
bling home at eight o’clock felt early. Now I’d kill 
just to be able to sleep until eight.” 

“We didn’t even make it till midnight,” Willow ad- 
mitted, bouncing the baby on her lap. “Good thing, 
because this little lady decided to start her new year 
at five- thirty.” 

“I stayed up till midnight!” Teddy yelled. “I saw 
the ball drop on TV at twelve. It’s in New York, you 
know? If you move there, will you take me to see it 
drop in real life?” he asked 

“Sure, Teddy,” I said feigning enthusiasm. The 
idea of me going to New York was seeming more 
and more real, and though this generally filled me 



224/256 


with a nervous, if conflicted, excitement, the image 
of me and Teddy hanging out together on New 
Year’s Eve left me feeling unbearably lonely. 

Mom looked at me, eyebrows arched. “It’s New 
Year’s Day, so I won’t give you shit for coming in at 
this hour. But if you’re hungover, you’re grounded.” 

“I’m not. I had one beer. I’m just tired.” 

“Just tired, is it? You sure?” Mom grabbed ahold 
of my wrist and turned me toward her. When she 
saw my stricken expression, she tilted her head to 
the side as if to say, You okay? I shrugged and bit 
my lip to keep from losing it. Mom nodded. She 
handed me a cup of coffee and led me to the table. 
She put down a plate of hash and a thick slice of 
sourdough bread, and even though I couldn’t ima- 
gine being hungry, my mouth watered and my 
stomach rumbled and I was suddenly ravenous. I 
ate silently, Mom watching me all the while. After 
everyone was done, Mom sent the rest of them into 
the living room to watch the Rose Parade on TV. 

“Everyone out,” she ordered. “Mia and I will do 
the washing up.” 

As soon as everyone was gone, Mom turned to me 
and I just fell against her, crying and releasing all of 




225/256 


the tension and uncertainty of the last few weeks. 
She stood there silently, letting me blubber all over 
her sweater. When I stopped, she held out the 
sponge. “You wash. I’ll dry. We’ll talk. I always find 
it calming. The warm water, the soap.” 

Mom picked up the dish towel and we went to 
work. And I told her about Adam and me. “It was 
like we had this perfect year and a half,” I said. “So 
perfect that I never even thought about the future. 
About it taking us in different directions.” 

Mom’s smile was both sad and knowing. “I 
thought about it.” 

I turned to her. She was staring straight out the 
window, watching a couple of sparrows bathe in a 
puddle. “I remember last year when Adam came 
over for Christmas Eve. I told your father that you’d 
fallen in love too soon.” 

“I know, I know. What does a dumb kid know 
about love?” 

Mom stopped drying a skillet. “That’s not what I 
meant. The opposite, really. You and Adam never 
struck me as a ‘high-school’ relationship,” Mom said 
making quote marks with her hands. “It was noth- 
ing like the drunken roll in the back of some guy’s 




226/256 


Chevy that passed for a relationship when I was in 
high school. You guys seemed, still seem, in love, 
truly, deeply.” She sighed. “But seventeen is an in- 
convenient time to be in love.” 

That made me smile and made the pit in my 
stomach soften a little. “Tell me about it,” I said. 
“Though if we weren’t both musicians, we could go 
to college together and be fine.” 

“That’s a cop-out, Mia,” Mom countered. “All re- 
lationships are tough. Just like with music, some- 
times you have harmony and other times you have 
cacophony. I don’t have to tell you that.” 

“I guess you’re right.” 

“And come on, music brought you two together. 
That’s what your father and I always thought. You 
were both in love with music and then you fell in 
love with each other. It was a little like that for your 
dad and me. I didn’t play but I listened. Luckily, I 
was a little older when we met.” 

I’d never told Mom about what Adam had said 
that night after the Yo-Yo Ma concert, when I’d 
asked him Why me? How the music was totally a 
part of it. “Yeah, but now I feel like it’s music that’s 
going to pull us apart.” 




227/256 


Mom shook her head. “That’s bullshit. Music 
can’t do that. Life might take you down different 
roads. But each of you gets to decide which one to 
take.” She turned to face me. “Adam’s not trying to 
stop you going to Juilliard, is he?” 

“No more than I’m trying to get him to move to 
New York. And it’s all ridiculous anyway. I might 
not even go.” 

“No, you might not. But you’re going somewhere. 
I think we all get that. And the same is true for 
Adam.” 

“At least he can go somewhere while still living 
here.” 

Mom shrugged. “Maybe. For now anyhow.” 

I put my face in my hands and shook my head. 
“What am I going to do?” I lamented. “I feel like I’m 
caught in a tug-of-war.” 

Mom shot me a sympathetic grimace. “I don’t 
know. But I do know that if you want to stay and be 
with him, I’d support that, though maybe I’m only 
saying that because I don’t think you’d be able to 
turn down Juilliard. But I’d understand if you chose 
love, Adam love, over music love. Either way you 




228/256 


win. And either way you lose. What can I tell you? 
Love’s a bitch.” 


Adam and I talked about it once more after that. We 
were at House of Rock, sitting on his futon. He was 
riffing about on his acoustic guitar. 

“I might not get in,” I told him. “I might wind up 
at school here, with you. In a way, I hope I don’t get 
accepted so I don’t have to choose.” 

“If you get in, the choice is already made, isn’t it?” 
Adam asked. 

It was. I would go. It didn’t mean I’d stop loving 
Adam or that we’d break up, but Mom and Adam 
were both right. I wouldn’t turn down Juilliard. 

Adam was silent for a minute, plinking away at 
his guitar so loud that I almost missed it when he 
said, “I don’t want to be the guy who doesn’t want 
you to go. If the tables were turned, you’d let me 
go-” 

“I kind of already have. In a way, you’re already 
gone. To your own Juilliard,” I said. 




229/256 


“I know,” Adam said quietly. “But I’m still here. 
And I’m still crazy in love with you.” 

“Me, too,” I said. And then we stopped talking for 
a while as Adam strummed an unfamiliar melody. I 
asked him what he was playing. 

“I’m calling it ‘The Girlfriend’s-Going-to- 
Juilliard-Leaving-My-Punk-Heart-in-Shreds 
Blues,’” he said, singing the title in an exaggeratedly 
twangy voice. Then he smiled that goofy shy smile 
that I felt like came from the truest part of him. “I’m 
kidding.” 

“Good,” I said. 

“Sort of,” he added. 


5:42 A.M. 

Adam is gone. He suddenly rushed out, calling to 
Nurse Ramirez that he’d forgotten something im- 
portant and would be back as soon as he could. He 
was already out the door when she told him that she 
was about to get off work. In fact, she just left, but 
not before making sure to inform the nurse who’d 
relieved Old Grumpy that “the young man with the 




230/256 


skinny pants and messy hair” is allowed to see me 
when he returns. 

Not that it matters. Willow rules the school now. 
She has been marching the troops through here all 
morning. After Gran and Gramps and Adam, Aunt 
Kate stopped by. Then it was Aunt Diane and Uncle 
Greg. Then my cousins shuffled in. Willow’s run- 
ning to and fro, a gleam in her eye. She’s up to 
something, but whether it’s trotting out loved ones 
to lobby on behalf of my continuing my earthly ex- 
istence or whether she’s simply bringing them in to 
say good-bye, I can’t say. 

Now it’s Kim’s turn. Poor Kim. She looks like she 
slept in a Dumpster. Her hair has staged a full-scale 
rebellion and more of it has escaped her mangled 
braid than remains tucked inside. She’s wearing one 
of what she calls her “turd sweaters,” the greenish, 
grayish, brownish lumpy masses her mom is always 
buying her. At first, Kim squints at me, as if I’m a 
bright, glaring light. But then it’s like she adjusts to 
the light and decides that even though I may look 
like a zombie, even though there are tubes sticking 
out of every which orifice, even though there’s blood 
on my thin blanket from where it’s seeped through 
the bandages, I’m still Mia and she’s still Kim. And 




231/256 


what do Mia and Kim like to do more than any- 
thing? Talk. 

Kim settles into the chair next to my bed. “How 
are you doing?” she asks. 

I’m not sure. I’m exhausted, but at the same time 
Adam’s visit has left me ... I don’t know what. Agit- 
ated. Anxious. Awake, definitely awake. Though I 
couldn’t feel it when he touched me, his presence 
stirred me up anyhow. I was just starting to feel 
grateful that he was here when he booked out of 
here like the devil was chasing him. Adam has spent 
the last ten hours trying to get in to see me, and now 
that he finally succeeded, he left ten minutes after 
arriving. Maybe I scared him. Maybe he doesn’t 
want to deal. Maybe I’m not the only chickenshit 
around here. After all, I spent the last day dreaming 
of him coming to me, and when he finally staggered 
into the ICU, if I had the strength, I would’ve run 
away. 

“Well, you would not believe the crazy night it’s 
been,” Kim says. Then she starts telling me about it. 
About her mom’s hysterics, about how she lost it in 
front of my relatives, who were very gracious about 
the whole thing. The fight they had outside the Ro- 
seland Theater in front of a bunch of punks and 




232/256 


hipsters. When Kim shouted at her crying mother to 
“pull it together and start acting like the adult 
around here” and then stalked off into the club leav- 
ing a shocked Mrs. Schein at the curb, a group of 
guys in spiked leather and fluorescent hair cheered 
and high-fived her. She tells me about Adam, his 
determination to get in to see me, how after he got 
kicked out of the ICU, he enlisted the help of his 
music friends, who were not at all the snobby 
scenesters she’d imagined them to be. Then she told 
me that a bona fide rock star had come to the hos- 
pital on my behalf. 

Of course, I know almost everything that Kim is 
telling me, but there is no way that she’d know that. 
Besides, I like having her recount the day to me. I 
like how Kim is talking to me normally, like Gran 
did earlier, just jabbering on, spinning a good yarn, 
as if we were together on my porch, drinking coffee 
(or an iced caramel frappuccino in Kim’s case) and 
catching up. 

I don’t know if once you die you remember things 
that happened to you when you were alive. It makes 
a certain logical sense that you wouldn’t. That being 
dead will feel like before you were born, which is to 
say, a whole lot of nothingness. Except that for me, 
at least, my prebirth years aren’t entirely blank. 




233/256 


Every now and again, Mom or Dad will be telling a 
story about something, about Dad catching his first 
salmon with Gramps, or Mom remembering the 
amazing Dead Moon concert she saw with Dad on 
their first date, and I’ll have an overpowering deja 
vu. Not just a sense that I’ve heard the story before, 
but that I’ve lived it. I can picture myself sitting on 
the riverbank as Dad pulls a hot-pink coho out of 
the water, even though Dad was all of twelve at the 
time. Or I can hear the feedback when Dead Moon 
played “D.O.A.” at the X-Ray, even though I’ve nev- 
er heard Dead Moon play live, even though the X- 
Ray Cafe shut down before I was born. But some- 
times the memories feel so real, so visceral, so per- 
sonal, that I confuse them with my own. 

I never told anyone about these “memories.” 
Mom probably would’ve said that I was there— as 
one of the eggs in her ovaries. Dad would’ve joked 
that he and Mom had tortured me with their stories 
one too many times and had inadvertently brain- 
washed me. And Gran would’ve told me that maybe 
I was there as an angel before I chose to become 
Mom and Dad’s kid. 

But now I wonder. And now I hope. Because 
when I go, I want to remember Kim. And I want to 
remember her like this: telling a funny story, 




234/256 


fighting with her crazy mom, being cheered on by 
punkers, rising to the occasion, finding little pockets 
of strength in herself that she had no idea she 
possessed. 

Adam is a different story. Remembering Adam 
would be like losing him all over again, and I’m not 
sure if I can bear that on top of everything else. 

Kim’s up to the part of Operation Distraction, 
when Brooke Vega and a dozen assorted punks des- 
cended upon the hospital. She tells me that before 
they got to the ICU, she was so scared of getting into 
trouble, but how when she burst inside the ward, 
she’d felt exhilarated. When the guard had grabbed 
her, she hadn’t been scared at all. “I kept thinking, 
what’s the worst that could happen? I go to jail. 
Mom has a conniption. I get grounded for a year.” 
She stops for a minute. “But after what’s happened 
today, that would be nothing. Even going to jail 
would be easy compared to losing you.” 

I know that Kim’s telling me this to try to keep me 
alive. She probably doesn’t realize that in a weird 
way, her remark frees me, just like Gramps’s per- 
mission did. I know it will be awful for Kim when I 
die, but I also think about what she said, about not 
being scared, about jail being easy compared to 




235/256 


losing me. And that’s how I know that Kim will be 
okay. Losing me will hurt; it will be the kind of pain 
that won’t feel real at first, and when it does, it will 
take her breath away. And the rest of her senior year 
will probably suck, what with her getting all that 
cloying your-best-friend’s-dead sympathy that will 
drive her so crazy, and also because really, we are 
each other’s only close friend at school. But she’ll 
deal. She’ll move on. She’ll leave Oregon. She’ll go 
to college. She’ll make new friends. She’ll fall in 
love. She’ll become a photographer, the kind who 
never has to go on a helicopter. And I bet she’ll be a 
stronger person because of what she’s lost today. I 
have a feeling that once you live through something 
like this, you become a little bit invincible. 

I know that makes me a bit of a hypocrite. If 
that’s the case, shouldn’t I stay? Soldier through it? 
Maybe if I’d had some practice, maybe if I’d had 
more devastation in my life, I would be more pre- 
pared to go on. It’s not that my life has been perfect. 
I’ve had disappointments and I’ve been lonely and 
frustrated and angry and all the crappy stuff every- 
one feels. But in terms of heartbreak, I’ve been 
spared. I’ve never toughened up enough to handle 
what I’d have to handle if I were to stay. 




236/256 


Kim is now telling me about being rescued from 
certain incarceration by Willow. As she describes 
how Willow took charge of the whole hospital, there 
is such admiration in her voice. I picture Kim and 
Willow becoming friends, even though there are 
twenty years between them. It makes me happy to 
imagine them drinking tea or going to the movies 
together, still connected to each other by the invis- 
ible chain of a family that no longer exists. 

Now Kim is listing all the people who are at the 
hospital or who have been, during the course of the 
day, ticking them off with her fingers: “Your grand- 
parents and aunts, uncles, and cousins. Adam and 
Brooke Vega and the various rabble-rousers who 
came with her. Adam’s bandmates Mike and Fitzy 
and Liz and her girlfriend, Sarah, all of whom have 
been downstairs in the waiting room since they got 
heaved out of the ICU. Professor Christie, who 
drove down and stayed half the night before driving 
back so she could sleep a few hours and shower and 
make some morning appointment she had. Henry 
and the baby, who are on their way over right now 
because the baby woke up at five in the morning 
and Henry called us and said that he could not stay 
at home any longer. And me and Mom,” Kim con- 
cludes. “Shoot. I lost count of how many people that 




237/256 


was. But it was a lot. And more have called and 
asked to come, but your aunt Diane told them to 
wait. She says that we’re making enough nuisance of 
ourselves. And I think by ‘us,’ she means me and 
Adam.” Kim stops and smiles for a split second. 
Then she makes this funny noise, a cross between a 
cough and a throat-clearing. I’ve heard her make 
this sound before; it’s what she does when she’s 
summoning her courage, getting ready to jump off 
the rocks and into the bracing river water. 

“I do have a point to all this,” she continues. 
“There are like twenty people in that waiting room 
right now. Some of them are related to you. Some of 
them are not. But we’re all your family.” 

She stops now. Leans over me so that the wisps of 
her hair tickle my face. She kisses me on the fore- 
head. “You still have a family,’’ she whispers. 


Last summer, we hosted an accidental Labor Day 
party at our house. It had been a busy season. Camp 
for me. Then we’d gone to Gran’s family’s Mas- 
sachusetts retreat. I felt like I had barely seen Adam 


238/256 


and Kim all summer. My parents were lamenting 
that they hadn’t seen Willow and Henry and the 
baby in months. “Henry says she’s starting to walk,” 
Dad noted that morning. We were all sitting in the 
living room in front of the fan, trying not to melt. 
Oregon was having a record heat wave. It was ten in 
the morning and pushing ninety degrees. 

Mom looked up at the calendar. “She’s ten 
months old already. Where has the time gone?” 
Then she looked at Teddy and me. “How is it hu- 
manly possible that I have a daughter who’s starting 
her senior year in high school? How in the hell can 
my baby boy be starting second grade?” 

“I’m not a baby,” Teddy shot back, clearly 
insulted. 

“Sorry, kid, unless we have another one, you’ll al- 
ways be my baby.” 

“Another one?” Dad asked with mock alarm. 

“Relax. I’m kidding— for the most part,” Mom 
said. “Let’s see how I feel when Mia leaves for 
college.” 

“I’m gonna be eight in December. Then I’m a man 
and you’ll have to call me ‘Ted,’” Teddy reported. 




239/256 


“Is that so?” I laughed, spraying orange juice 
through my nose. 

“That’s what Casey Carson told me,” Teddy said, 
his mouth set into a determined line. 

My parents and I groaned. Casey Carson was 
Teddy’s best friend, and we all liked him a lot and 
thought his parents seemed like such nice people, so 
we didn’t get how they could give their child such a 
ridiculous name. 

“Well, if Casey Carson says so,” I said, giggling, 
and soon Mom and Dad were laughing, too. 

“What’s so funny?” Teddy demanded. 

“Nothing, Little Man,” Dad said. “It’s just the 
heat.” 

“Can we still do sprinklers today?” Teddy asked. 
Dad had promised him he could run through the 
sprinklers that afternoon even though the governor 
had asked everyone in the state to conserve water 
this summer. That request had peeved Dad, who 
claimed that we Oregonians suffer eight months of 
rain a year and should be exempt from ever worry- 
ing about water conservation. 

“Damn straight you can,” Dad said. “Flood the 
place if you want.” 




240/256 


Teddy seemed placated. “If the baby can walk, 
then she can walk through the sprinklers. Can she 
come into the sprinklers with me?” 

Mom looked at Dad. “That’s not a bad idea,” she 
said. “I think Willow’s off today.” 

“We could have a barbecue,” Dad said. “It is 
Labor Day and grilling in this heat would certainly 
qualify as labor.” 

“Plus, we’ve got a freezer full of steaks from when 
your father decided to order that side of beef,” Mom 
said. “Why not?” 

“Can Adam come?” I asked. 

“Of course,” Mom said. “We haven’t seen much of 
your young man lately.” 

“I know,” I said. “Things are starting to happen 
for the band,” I said. At the time I was excited about 
it. Genuinely and completely. Gran had only re- 
cently planted the seed of Juilliard in my head, but 
it hadn’t taken root. I hadn’t decided to apply yet. 
Things with Adam had not gotten weird yet. 

“If the rock star can handle a humble picnic with 
squares like us,” Dad joked. 




241/256 


“If he can handle a square like me, he can handle 
squares like you,” I joked back. “I think I’ll invite 
Kim, too.” 

“The more the merrier,” Mom said. “We’ll make it 
a blowout like in the olden days.” 

“When dinosaurs roamed the earth?” Teddy 
asked. 

“Exactly,” Dad said. “When dinosaurs roamed the 
earth and your mom and I were young.” 


About twenty people showed up. Henry, Willow, the 
baby, Adam, who brought Fitzy, Kim, who brought a 
cousin visiting from New Jersey, plus a whole bunch 
of friends of my parents whom they had not seen in 
ages. Dad hauled our ancient barbecue out of the 
basement and spent the afternoon scrubbing it. We 
grilled up steaks and, this being Oregon, tofu pups 
and veggie burgers. There was watermelon, which 
we kept cool in a bucket of ice, and a salad made 
with vegetables from the organic farm that some of 
Mom and Dad’s friends had started. Mom and I 
made three pies with wild blackberries that Teddy 
and I had picked. We drank Pepsi out of these old- 
fashioned bottles that Dad had found at some an- 
cient country store, and I swear they tasted better 




242/256 


than the regular kind. Maybe it was because it was 
so hot, or that the party was so last minute, or 
maybe because everything tastes better on the grill, 
but it was one of those meals that you know you’ll 
remember. 

When Dad turned on the sprinkler for Teddy and 
the baby, everyone else decided to run through it. 
We left it on so long that the brown grass turned in- 
to a big slippery puddle and I wondered if the gov- 
ernor himself might come and tell us off. Adam 
tackled me and we laughed and squirmed around 
on the lawn. It was so hot, I didn’t bother changing 
into dry clothes, just kept dousing myself whenever 
I got too sweaty. By the end of the day, my sundress 
was stiff. Teddy had taken his shirt off and had 
streaked himself with mud. Dad said he looked like 
one of the boys from Lord of the Flies. 

When it started to get dark, most people left to 
catch the fireworks display at the university or to 
see a band called Oswald Five-o play in town. A 
handful of people, including Adam, Kim, Willow, 
and Henry, stayed. When it cooled off, Dad lit a 
campfire on the lawn, and we roasted marshmal- 
lows. Then the musical instruments appeared. Dad’s 
snare drum from the house, Henry’s guitar from his 
car, Adam’s spare guitar from my room. Everyone 




243/256 


was jamming together, singing songs: Dad’s songs, 
Adam’s songs, old Clash songs, old Wipers songs. 
Teddy was dancing around, the blond of his hair re- 
flecting the golden flames. I remember watching it 
all and getting that tickling in my chest and thinking 
to myself: This is what happiness feels like. 

At one point, Dad and Adam stopped playing and 
I caught them whispering about something. Then 
they went inside, to get more beer, they claimed. 
But when they returned they were carrying my cello. 

“Oh, no, I’m not giving a concert,” I said. 

“We don’t want you to,” Dad said. “We want you 
to play with us.” 

“No way,” I said. Adam had occasionally tried to 
get me to “jam” with him and I always refused. 
Lately he’d started joking about us playing air- 
guitar-air-cello duets, which was about as far as I 
was willing to go. 

“Why not, Mia?” Kim said. “Are you such a 
classical-music snob?” 

“It’s not that,” I said, suddenly feeling panicked. 
“It’s just that the two styles don’t fit together.” 

“Says who?” Mom asked, her eyebrows raised. 




244/256 


“Yeah, who knew you were such a musical segreg- 
ationist?” Henry joked. 

Willow rolled her eyes at Henry and turned to me. 
“Pretty please,” she said as she rocked the baby to 
sleep in her lap. “I never get to hear you play 
anymore.” 

“C’mon, Mee,” Henry said. “You’re among 
family.” 

“Totally,” Kim said. 

Adam took my hand and caressed the inside of 
my wrist with his fingers. “Do it for me. I really 
want to play with you. Just once.” 

I was about to shake my head, to reaffirm that my 
cello had no place among the jamming guitars, no 
place in the punk-rock world. But then I looked out 
at Mom, who was smirking at me, as if issuing a 
challenge, and Dad, who was tapping on his pipe, 
pretending to be nonchalant so as not to apply any 
pressure, and Teddy, who was jumping up and 
down— though I think it was because he was hopped 
up on marshmallows, not because he had any desire 
to hear me play— and Kim and Willow and Henry all 
peering at me like this really mattered, and Adam, 
looking as awed and proud as he always did when 




245/256 


he listened to me play. And I was a little scared of 
falling on my face, of not blending, of making bad 
music. But everyone was looking at me so intently, 
wanting me to join in so much, and I realized that 
sounding bad wasn’t the worst thing in the world 
that could happen. 

So I played. And even though you wouldn’t think 
it, the cello didn’t sound half bad with all those gui- 
tars. In fact, it sounded pretty amazing. 


7:16 A.M. 

It’s morning. And inside the hospital, there’s a dif- 
ferent kind of dawn, a rustling of covers, a clearing 
of the eyes. In some ways, the hospital never goes to 
sleep. The lights stay on and the nurses stay awake, 
but even though it’s still dark outside, you can tell 
that things are waking up. The doctors are back, 
yanking on my eyelids, shining their lights at me, 
frowning as they scribble notes in my chart as 
though I’ve let them down. 

I don’t care anymore. I’m tired of this all, and it 
will be over soon. The social worker is back on duty 
again, too. It looks like the night’s sleep had little 




246/256 


impact on her. Her eyes are still heavy, her hair a 
kinky mess. She reads my chart and listens to up- 
dates from the nurses on my bumpy night, which 
seems to make her even more tired. The nurse with 
the blue-black skin is also back. She greeted me by 
telling me how glad she was to see me this morning, 
how she’d been thinking about me last night, hop- 
ing I’d be here. Then she noticed the bloodstain on 
my blanket and tsked tsked before hustling off to get 
me a new one. 

After Kim left, there haven’t been any more visit- 
ors. I guess Willow has run out of people to lobby 
me with. I wonder if this deciding business is 
something that all the nurses are aware of. Nurse 
Ramirez sure knew about it. And I think the nurse 
with me now knows it, too, judging by how congrat- 
ulatory she’s acting that I made it through the night. 
And Willow seems like she knows it, too, with the 
way she’s been marching everyone through here. I 
like these nurses so much. I hope they will not take 
my decision personally. 

I am so tired now that I can barely blink my eyes. 
It’s all just a matter of time, and part of me wonders 
why I’m delaying the inevitable. But I know why. 
I’m waiting for Adam to come back. Though it 
seems like he has been gone for an eternity, it’s 




247/256 


probably only been an hour. And he asked me to 
wait, so I will. That’s the least I can do for him. 


My eyes are closed so I hear him before I see him. I 
hear the raspy, quick rushes of his lungs. He is pant- 
ing like he just ran a marathon. Then I smell the 
sweat on him, a clean musky scent that I’d bottle 
and wear as perfume if I could. I open my eyes. 
Adam has closed his. But the lids are puffy and 
pink, so I know what he’s been doing. Is that why he 
went away? To cry without my seeing? 

He doesn’t so much sit in the chair as fall into it, 
like clothes heaped onto the floor at the end of a 
long day. He covers his face with his hands and 
takes deep breaths to steady himself. After a 
minute, he drops his hands into his lap. “Just 
listen,” he says with a voice that sounds like 
shrapnel. 

I open my eyes wide now. I sit up as much as I 
can. And I listen. 

“Stay.” With that one word, Adam’s voice catches, 
but he swallows the emotion and pushes forward. 




248/256 


“There’s no word for what happened to you. There’s 
no good side of it. But there is something to live for. 
And I’m not talking about me. It’s just ... I don’t 
know. Maybe I’m talking shit. I know I’m in shock. I 
know I haven’t digested what happened to your par- 
ents, to Teddy ...” When he says Teddy, his voice 
cracks and an avalanche of tears tumbles down his 
face. And I think: I love you. 

I hear him take gulpfuls of air to steady himself. 
And then he continues: “All I can think about is how 
fucked up it would be for your life to end here, now. 
I mean, I know that your life is fucked up no matter 
what now, forever. And I’m not dumb enough to 
think that I can undo that, that anyone can. But I 
can’t wrap my mind around the notion of you not 
getting old, having kids, going to Juilliard, getting to 
play that cello in front of a huge audience, so that 
they can get the chills the way I do every time I see 
you pick up your bow, every time I see you smile at 
me. 

“If you stay, I’ll do whatever you want. I’ll quit the 
band, go with you to New York. But if you need me 
to go away, I’ll do that, too. I was talking to Liz and 
she said maybe coming back to your old life would 
just be too painful, that maybe it’d be easier for you 
to erase us. And that would suck, but I’d do it. I can 




249/256 


lose you like that if I don’t lose you today. I’ll let you 
go. If you stay.” 

Then it is Adam who lets go. His sobs burst like 
fists pounding against tender flesh. 

I close my eyes. I cover my ears. I cannot watch 
this. I cannot hear this. 

But then, it is no longer Adam that I hear. It’s that 
sound, the low moan that in an instant takes flight 
and turns into something sweet. It’s the cello. Adam 
has placed headphones over my lifeless ears and is 
laying an iPod down on my chest. He’s apologizing, 
saying that he knows this isn’t my favorite but it was 
the best he could do. He turns up the volume so I 
can hear the music floating across the morning air. 
Then he takes my hand. 

It is Yo-Yo Ma. Playing Andante con poco e moto 
rubato. The low piano plays almost as if in warning. 
In comes the cello, like a heart bleeding. And it’s 
like something inside of me implodes. 

I am sitting around the breakfast table with my 
family, drinking hot coffee, laughing at Teddy’s 
chocolate-chip mustache. The snow is blowing 
outside. 




250/256 


I am visiting a cemetery. Three graves under a 
tree on a hill overlooking the river. 

I am lying with Adam, my head on his chest, on a 
sandy bank next to the river. 

I am hearing people say the word orphan and 
realize that they’re talking about me. 

I am walking through New York City with Kim, 
the skyscrapers casting shadows on our faces. 

I am holding Teddy on my lap, tickling him as he 
giggles so hard he keels over. 

I am sitting with my cello, the one Mom and Dad 
gave me after my first recital. My fingers caress the 
wood and the pegs, which time and touch have worn 
smooth. My bow is poised over the strings now. I 
am looking at my hand, waiting to start playing. 

I am looking at my hand, being held by Adam’s 
hand. 

Yo-Yo Ma continues to play, and it’s like the piano 
and cello are being poured into my body, the same 
way that the IV and blood transfusions are. And the 
memories of my life as it was, and the flashes of it as 
it might be, are coming so fast and furious. I feel 
like I can no longer keep up with them but they keep 
coming and everything is colliding, until I cannot 




251/256 


take it anymore. Until I cannot be like this one 
second longer. 

There is a blinding flash, a pain that rips through 
me for one searing instant, a silent scream from my 
broken body. For the first time, I can sense how 
fully agonizing staying will be. 

But then I feel Adam’s hand. Not sense it, but feel 
it. I’m not sitting huddled in the chair anymore. I’m 
lying on my back in the hospital bed, one again with 
my body. 

Adam is crying and somewhere inside of me I am 
crying, too, because I’m feeling things at last. I’m 
feeling not just the physical pain, but all that I have 
lost, and it is profound and catastrophic and will 
leave a crater in me that nothing will ever fill. But 
I’m also feeling all that I have in my life, which in- 
cludes what I have lost, as well as the great un- 
known of what life might still bring me. And it’s all 
too much. The feelings pile up, threatening to crack 
my chest wide open. The only way to survive them is 
to concentrate on Adam’s hand. Grasping mine. 

And suddenly I just need to hold his hand more 
than I’ve ever needed anything in this world. Not 
just be held by it, but hold it back. I aim every re- 
maining ounce of energy into my right hand. I’m 




252/256 


weak, and this is so hard. It’s the hardest thing I will 
ever have to do. I summon all the love I have ever 
felt, I summon all the strength that Gran and 
Gramps and Kim and the nurses and Willow have 
given me. I summon all the breath that Mom, Dad, 
and Teddy would fill me with if they could. I sum- 
mon all my own strength, focus it like a laser beam 
into the fingers and palm of my right hand. I picture 
my hand stroking Teddy’s hair, grasping a bow 
poised above my cello, interlaced with Adam’s. 

And then I squeeze. 

I slump back, spent, unsure of whether I just did 
what I did. Of what it means. If it registered. If it 
matters. 

But then I feel Adam’s grip tighten, so that the 
grasp of his hand feels like it is holding my entire 
body. Like it could lift me up right out of this bed. 
And then I hear the sharp intake of his breath fol- 
lowed by the sound of his voice. It’s the first time 
today I can truly hear him. 

“Mia?” he asks. 




ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 


Several people came together in a short amount of 
time to make If I Stay possible. It starts with Gillian 
Aldrich, who started crying (in a good way) when I 
told her about my idea. This proved to be quite a 
good motivator to get started. 

Tamara Glenny, Eliza Griswold, Kim Sevcik, and 
Sean Smith took time out of their hectic schedules 
to read early drafts and offer much-needed encour- 
agement. For their enduring generosity and friend- 
ship, I love and thank them. Some people help you 
keep your head straight; Marjorie Ingall helps me 
keep my heart straight, and for that I love and thank 
her. Thank you also to Jana and Moshe Banin. 

Sarah Burnes is my agent in the truest sense of 
the word, harnessing her formidable intelligence, 
insight, passion, and warmth to shepherd the words 
that I write to the people who should read them. 
She and the superb Courtney Gatewood and 
Stephanie Cabot have made miracles happen where 
this book is concerned. 

When I first met with the team at Penguin, I felt 
like I was sitting down with family. My extraordin- 
ary editor, Julie Strauss-Gabel, has lavished Mia 



254/256 


and her family (not to mention me) with the careful 
attention and love you’d hope to get from a relative. 
She is “Julie-special.” Don Weisberg put both heart 
and muscle into this book, and the editorial, sales, 
marketing, publicity, and design people have all 
gone above and beyond, and for that I want to indi- 
vidually thank: Heather Alexander, Scottie 

Bowditch, Leigh Butler, Mary-Margaret Callahan, 
Lisa DeGroff, Erin Dempsey, Jackie Engel, Felicia 
Frazier, Kristin Gilson, Annie Hurwitz, Ras Shahn 
Johnson-Baker, Deborah Kaplan, Eileen Kreit, Kim- 
berly Lauber, Rosanne Lauer, Stephanie Owens 
Lurie, Barbara Marcus, Casey Mclntrye, Steve 
Meltzer, Shanta Newlin, Mary Raymond, Emily 
Romero, Holly Ruck, Jana Singer, Laurence Tucci, 
Allison Verost, Allan Winebarger, Courtney Wood, 
Heather Wood, and Lisa Yoskowitz. And finally a 
huge thank you to the field reps who worked so hard 
on behalf of this book. (Phew). 

Music is a huge part of this story, and I drew a lot 
of inspiration from Yo-Yo Ma— whose own work in- 
forms much of Mia’s story— and from Glen Hansard 
and Marketa Irglova, whose song “Falling Slowly” I 
probably listened to more than two hundred times 
while working on the book.

Thanks to my Oregon contingent: Greg and Diane 
Rios, who have been our compatriots through all 
this. John and Peg Christie, whose grace, dignity, 
and generosity continue to move me. Jennifer Lar- 
son, M.D., an old friend and, as luck would have it 
an emergency room doctor, who enlightened me 
about Glasgow Coma Scales, among other medical 
details. 

My parents— Lee and Ruth Forman— and my sib- 
lings— Tamar Schamhart and Greg Forman— are my 
cheerleaders and most steadfast fans, who ignore 
my failings (professional ones, anyhow) and celeb- 
rate my successes as if they were their own (which 
they are). Thank you also to Karen Forman, Robert 
Schamhart, and Detta Tucker. 

I didn’t immediately recognize how much of this 
book is about the way parents transform their lives 
for their children. Willa Tucker teaches me this les- 
son every day and is occasionally forgiving when I 
am too absorbed playing make-believe in my head 
to play make-believe with her. 

Without my husband, Nick Tucker, none of this 
would be. I owe him everything. 

Finally, my deepest thanks go to R.D.T.J., who in- 
spire me in so many ways and who show me every 
single day that there is such a thing as immortality.
