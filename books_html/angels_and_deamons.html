ANGELS 



CHAPTER ONE 

"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many 
angels round about the throne and the beasts, and the 
elders: and the number o[ them was ten thousand 
times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;" 

Revelation 5:11. 

The subject of this message and several to follow is 
"Angels." In these messages we will discuss with you 
the Bible teaching concerning an order of supematurally 
created, usually invisible, spirit beings, dwelling in heaven, 
in countless millions, active upon this earth, though un- 
seen by men, and filling the atmosphere around this earth, 
and probably inhabiting some of the countless millions of 
planets and heavenly bodies which form the Universe. 
These beings are called in the Bible, angels, as wellas by 
several other names. Now the word, angel, both in the 
Hebrew and in the Greek, means simply "a messenger," 
and therefore gives us immediately the key to the most 
important task and function for which they were created. 
While they are engaged in many other activities, their 
prime duty seems to be that of praising and serving God, 
and carrying the message of Jehovah to His creatures. 

BIBLE FULL OF ANGELS 

It is impossible to believe the Bible without also be- 
lieving in the existence of angels, for the Scriptures are 
full of angels from Genesis to Revelation. While great 
ignorance exists among many Christians who ought to 
know their Bibles, there are few subjects in the Bible 
which are more clear and definite in their detail, than 
the subject of angels, both the holy angels in heaven, 
and the fallen angels from heaven. Yet, all sorts of 
foolish superstitions have surrounded the teaching of the 
Bible concerning these beings. Traditions have corrupted 

— 1 — 



the revelation until today, many people, like the Saddu- 
cees of old, completely reject the existence of angels, 
while others though mentally accepting the fact, make 
no effort to find out what the Bible has to say about 
them. In order to show how prominent the doctrine of 
angels is in Scripture, consider these facts. In the Old 
Testament, angels are mentioned 108 times, and in the 
New Testament, 165 times, a grand total of 237 times, 
four times as often as there are books in the entire Bible. 
To neglect such a subject, therefore, given such promin- 
ence in the Bible, cannot but impoverish your spiritual 
life and keep you blind to a revelation which the Lord 
considered important enough to mention almost 300 times 
in Scripture. 

HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW? 

Will you ask yourself pointedly, right now, how much 
do I really know about the Bible teaching of these myriads 
of spirit beings who have so much to do with the carry- 
ing out of God's will on this earth, and whose personal 
ministry so vitally affects me when Jesus comes, and 
throughout all eternity? In the hope of stimulating you 
to study this subject for yourself, we bring this series 
of messages in which we shall try both to dissipate any 
superstitions and foolish notions about them, and then 
seek to give you the Holy Spirit's picture which speaks 
Avith authority and finality in the Bible. We shall trace 
their origin in creation, their number, their different 
ranks, and authority and division, the nature of their 
ministry, their association with us now, and in the hour 
of death, their present abode and home, and their part 
in the final consumation of God's purpose in the setting 
up of the Kingdom for eternity. First of all, will you 
notice then the, 

ORIGIN OF ANGELS 

Angels are first of all, created beings, though we do 
not know just how far back they were created. We do 
know, however, that they were created before this world 
was made, for Scripture tells us that they were present 

— 2 — 



at the creation of the earth. In Job 38 we read one of 
the several references to this fact. God is speaking to 
Job and He asks, 

"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of 
the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 

Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou know- 
est: or who hath stretched the line upon it? 

Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? 
or who laid the corner stone thereof; 

When the morning stars sang together, and all the 
sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:3-7. 

It is unanimously agreed among Bible students that 
Job's reference here to "morning stars" and "the sons of 
God" is to the angels in heaven, as well as here upon the 
earth. The word, "morning stars" refers to these angelic 
beings, and we know also, that in many passages in 
Scripture, the expression "sons of God" has a special 
reference to the angels which God has created. They 
are usually invisible to the human eye, although from 
time to time for special definite reasons they assume 
human forms and appear unto men, especially in the 
days of the Old Testament. 

THE NUMBER OF ANGELS 

Although these angels are invisible to the human 
eye, except when they assume this special visible form, 
the Bible nevertheless teaches that they do exist, and 
this in stupendous and incalcuable numbers. This is 
mentioned again and again in the Bible, giving us some 
idea of the great hosts which today in heaven surround 
the Throne of God, the great company who are on the 
earth today, going forth between heaven and earth, carry- 
ing out God's orders. Daniel tells us in Chapter 7, 

"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before 
him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten 
thousand times fen thousand stood before him." 

Daniel 7:10 

_3 — 



Here is a plain, unmistakable statement that the 
number of angels in heaven alone runs into countless 
millions, The Hebrew, remember, had no word for million, 
but expressed it by saying, "a thousand thousands," and 
so the expression, thousand thousands, means a million, 
and ten thousand times ten thousand, of course, would 
be a hundred million. In the book of the Revelation we 
read: 

"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many 
angels round about the throne and the beasts and the 
elders: and the number of them was ten thousand 
times ten thousand, and thoixsands of thousands." 

Revelation 5:11 

The writer of Hebrews also says: 

"But ye are come unto Mount Sion. and unto the 
city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to 
an innumerable company of angels." Hebrews 12:22. 

THE LORD OF HOSTS 

This too is the definite meaning of the expression 
so often found throughout the Scripture, "The Lord of 
Hosts." The word hosts, means literally "armies," and 
refers to the armies of heaven, the holy angels. In 
heaven, here upon th' earth and in the atmosphere all 
about us is this great company of spirits, unseen but 
real, just as really persons and creatures as we are, but 
belonging to a different order of created beings. How 
many other creatures God has in this great universe 
which are neither material, physical like our bodies, nor 
spiritual like the angels, we do not know, but certainly 
God IS not limited to the creation of only two classes of 
creatures, physical and spiritual. He may indeed have 
a thousand other forms of created beings utterly un- 
known and unimaginable to us, but nevertheless real 
creatures to give to Him glory, and to do His will. 

GOD LOVES VARIETY 

But all these angelic beings are not the same, either 
m appearance or in rank, in position, in power, or in 

— 4 — 



work As there are no two human beings exactly alike, 
so the Bible suggests that no two angels are exactly 
alike, but all have distinct personalities, belonging to 
special groups or ranks, classified as to their position 
and their ministry and their work. The hosts of heaven 
are perfectly organized. Each member of that celestial 
army knows his own place, and his own work and ministry. 
There are higher angels and there are lower angels in 
rank There are those who have a special mission to 
perform, and seem to be limited to this mission. It is 
not a difference of perfection or of holiness, but simply 
a difference of authority and rank and work. Why this 
is, we do not know, but God has so decreed it by sovereign 
creation, and thus revealed it to us in Scripture. That 
this is we know, from the many passages of the Word. 
In Colossians we read: 

"For by him were all things created, thai are in 
heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, 
whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principali- 
ties, or powers: all things were created by him, and 
{or him." Col. 1:16. 

FALLEN ANGELS ALSO 

Not only are these angels in heaven organized in 
companies and ranks called "thrones, dominions, princi- 
palities and powers," but even the fallen angels, the 
demons under the leadership of Satan, are still thus or- 
ganized and Paul tells us of them in Ephesians 6: 

"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but 
against principalities, against powers, against the 
rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual 
wickedness in high places." Ephesians 6:12. 

VARIOUS FUNCTIONS 
Not only are the angels organized in different com- 
panies and ranks for special definite service, but individ- 
ual angels have individual tasks. Gabriel, the mighty 
angel, had a definite ministry in conveying the most im- 
portant messages to man which God would not entrust 
to lesser beings. Michael, the chief or the arch-angel, 

— 5 — 



has a definite and apparently exclusive commission, to 
watch over the nation of Israel and to protect her, and is 
never mentioned except in the role of protecting God's 
ancient covenant people, Israel. Some of these high- 
ranking angels are called "princes," denoting their high 
office. -Satan before his fall, himself was a high ranking 
angel, probably the highest in heaven, and was called 
Lucifer, the special guardian of the Throne of God, 
before he was lifted up with pride, and cast out from the 
presence of Almighty God. But more about him later in 
subsequent messages. 

SOME SUPERSTITIONS 
Before we close this introductory message on the 
subject of angels, we would like to call your attention to 
some unfounded traditions and foolish superstitions which 
have been fixed in the minds of a great many people 
concerning these angelic beings. First of all will you 
note, therefore, that angels are always spoken of in the 
masculine. There are no female angels, but they are 
invariably referred to in the masculine gender While 
they are sexless beings according to the revelation of 
bcnpture, only in the fact that they do not marry or 
inter-manj and have no offspring, they are nevertheless 
always referred to as masculine. They were all created 
at one time, in the beginning, and there has been neither 
increase nor decrease in their number. There is no mul- 
tiplication among angels; hence, will you notice, there 
are no baby angels. Those nice, pretty pictures which 
you see in works of art and even painted on church walls 
and ceilings and stained glass windows, of cute little baby 
angels with little sprouting wings has absolutely no foun- 
dation in the Bible at all, but are an indication of a mis- 
understanding of the Scriptures. Why, I ask, are angels 
so often presented with feminine faces when there are no 
female angels? Why do we imagine little winged baby 
cherubs when they do not even exist? Think these things 
over when you look at some of them in our religious 

Neither do the angels generally have wings. There 
IS no verse in the Bible which presents angels as having 
wings. They are said to fly in a few instances, but any 
reference to wings of angels is quite absent. Of course, 

— 6 — 



you will refer me immediately to the cherubim and the 
seraphim which are mentioned a few times in the Bible, 
especially in the Book of Ezekiel, and called also beasts 
or living creatures, as appearing over the ark of the 
Covenant with wings overspreading the Mercy Seat, but 
I remind you that these are an entirely different order of 
beings. They are never called angels, and I do not be- 
lieve that they are angels, but another order of spirit 
beings for a special purpose and ministry to God. They 
are called "beasts" or "living creatures," and have a min- 
istry distinct and peculiar, wholly different from the 
angels. Sometime later, the Lord willing, we would like 
to take up the peculiar nature and ministry of the cher- 
ubim and the seraphim. Angels do move swiftly, how- 
ever, and we know that they can travel with the speed of 
light. 

Neither are you and I going to have wings when we 
get to heaven, for the silly superstition that when we go 
to heaven we are going to be angels is also something 
which is without a shred of evidence in the Scriptures. 
We are not going to be angels, but we will be above the 
angels. We are said to judge the angels, and the angels 
will be our ministering servants. The Bible tells us 
clearly, that angels are, "spirits sent forth to minister 
unto them that shall be the heirs of salvation." Now 
angels, as we mentioned a moment ago, are sometimes 
called the sons of God, and we too are called the sons of 
God in Scripture, but this does not make us identical. Ihe 
angels are the sons of God by their first creation. We 
are the sons of God by the New Creation. The angels 
belong to the household of God; we belong to the family 
of God. The angels are servants in God's house, we are 
children in God's house, and heirs in the family of God. 
• Oh, what a wonderful revelation! When we get to glory 
we shall have angels as our servants. Some years ago a 
very wealthy man happened to visit our home, and he 
expressed great surprise that we had no servants at all 
about the house, and that Mrs. De Haan did all the work, 
with a little help from me. This man was used to butlers 
and maids and cooks, and was quite surprised that we had 
none, but I told him, "I can afford to wait for a later 
day, for I am going. to have the very hosts of heaven, 

— 7 — 



and the armies of God waiting upon me and carrying out 
my every wish throughout all eternity." 

In conclusion, all men will have to spend eternity in 
the presence of angels. We who are redeemed will spend 
etermty with Christ in the presence of holy angels with 
every need cared for, but you who are lost will have to 
spend an eternity with the Devil and his angels, for Jesus 
said m Matthew 25, that the wicked shall be consigned^ to 
the place "prepared for the Devil and his angels." Where, 
and with whom will YOU spend eternity?

CHAPTER TWO 



"For unto which o{ the angels said he at any time. 
Thou art my Son. this day have 1 begotten thee? And 
again. I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me 
a Son? 

And again, when he bringeth in the {irstbegotten 
into the world, he saith. And let all the angels of God 
worship him. 

And of the angels he saith. Who maketh his angels 
spirits, and his ministers a {lame of fire. ' 

Hebrews 1:5-7. 

This is only one of over two hundred and fifty times 
in which the Bible mentions angels, the angels of God, 
indicating the prominent place they occupy in the revela- 
tion of Scripture. In this first chapter of Hebrews the 
writer is showing the superiority of the Lord Jesus over 
the angels, the highest created beings which came from 
the hand of God. We have pointed out already that they 
are created beings, all created at one time, wholly subject 
to and forever worshipping the Lord Jesus, the Eternal 
Son of God. In our first message on "Angels" we em- 
phasized the importance of studying what the Bible says 
about these spirit beings. No one can profitably neglect 
what the Bible has to say about them, for God wants us 
to know all the Scripture and to be fully and completely 
informed about all matters of which the Bible treats, 
and especially the subject of angels, for they are going 
to be our constant attendants and companions throughout 
eternity. We also pointed out that they are created 
beings who were already present when God formed the 
world. We saw that they exist in countless numbers in 
heaven, on the earth, in the atmosphere, and probably 
inhabiting the millions of planets and heavenly bodies 
just as they once lived here upon the earth.

IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY OF ANGELS 
In every age there have been those who have denied 
the existence of angelic beings, together with the rest of 
the supernatural. The Sadducees of Jesus' day denied the 
existence of these ministers of God, as well as the reality 
of the resurrection. It is often said that belief in angels 
is immaterial to salvation, that it is one of the non- 
essential doctrines of little consequence. But such shallow 
statements only betrays ingnorance of the very subject 
we pass judgment upon. For the Bible is crystal-clear 
on the importance of the truth of angels. All the saints 
of the Old Testament believed in them. The prophets 
Mid the seers of old with one accord bear testimony to 
their activity in the revelation of God. To state, there- 
fore, that there are no angels is to reduce the Bible to a 
book of fables and superstition, to label the writers of 
Scripture as ignorant and deluded fanatics, but worse 
than that, it means to impune the truthfulness and the 
authority of Jesus Himself. Our Lord Jesus constantly 
affirmed and asserted the existence of angels, referring 
to them time and time and time again. Skeptics have 
tried to answer this problem by saying two things; first, 
there are those who claim that Jesus Himself did not 
know any better, and He accepted the existence of angels 
without proof. The second argument is milder, but just 
as dangerous. They tell us that Jesus knew better than 
to_ believe in angels, but knowing the deep-rooted super- 
stition an belief of His hearers in the existence of angels. 
He did not attempt to correct them, but rather adapted 
Himself to the age of ignorance and assumed to believe 
It when He really did not. Either one of these arguments 
would destroy both the veracity of the Bible and the de- 
pendability and the truthfulness of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

ACTIVE IN JESUS' MINISTRY 

The facts of Scripture, however, are the exact oppo- 
site. The whole life and ministry of the Lord Jesus may 
truly be termed an angelic ministry, since angels seemed 
to be with Him from the very beginning to the end. His 
birth was announced by an angel, and heralded by a great 
multitude of the heavenly host. When He was being 
threatened by Herod, it was an angel who warned Joseph 

— 10 — 



to flee into Egypt. In the temptation in the wilderness 
angels came t! minister to Him. In the garden it was 
an angel who strengthened Him. At the tomb angels 
waited to announce His resurrection. At His ascension 
He sent back two heavenly messengers to assure the 
hearts of the disciples of His return, and when Jesus 
does return, it will be with the hosts of heaven, the armies 
of the angels. The doctrine of angels is so closely bound 
up with our faith in Christ that I make bpldto say that a 
man can no more be saved without believing in angels 
than without believing in Christ Himself, for the same 
Bible clearly teaches both, and to reject part of the 
Scripture means to destroy the whole. 

THE NATURE OF ANGELS 
We take up next the interesting study of the nature 
of these powerful beings created by God. We must re- 
member as we study their peculiar and different nature 
that they are created beings. As such, they have all the 
limitations of creatures, and do not share any of tne 
divine attributes which only the Creator possesses. Angels, 
therefore, are not omniscient, but they are limited in 
their knowledge, and dependent upon their information 
and knowledge concerning all things upon the revelation 
of God just as we are. That they are exceedingly wise, 
since the unf alien angels have not been perv^erted by sm, 
is very clear in the Bible, but they do not know all things. 
The Bible tells us that they cannot comprehend the diyme 
plan of salvation, but "angels have desired to look into 
it " They are also ignorant, according to Jesus, ot tne 
exact time of Christ's return, although they will be very, 
very active in the glorious event. 

Moreover, angels are not omnipresent, but like all 
creatures, can be present in only one place at a time. 
They cannot be in heaven and on earth at the same 
instant. Many references in the Bible, however, do sug- 
gest that they travel with exceeding swiftness, with the 
rapidity of light, but they cannot transport themselves 
from one place to another without the lapse of time. 
Jesus could do this in His resurrected body, to be sure. 
He was with His disciples in Emmaus one moment, and 
immediately after He was in the upper room with the 
apostles in Jerusalem. But not so with angehc beings. 

— 11 — 



They must take time to travel from place to place. In 
the ninth chapter of Daniel we have the angel Gabriel 

wff^.'"f^.^T?'' *';e* ^' ^^ ^^^^" to P'-^y- he (Gabriel) 
was sent to bring the answer to Daniel, but he did not 
arrive until Daniel had almost finished his prayer. Since 
we do not know where Gabriel was when the command- 
ment to go to Daniel was given, we cannot, of course, 
speculate on the distance which he traveled, and there- 
fore, with what speed he came; but it is well to remember 
because from time immemorial there has been a tend- 
ency to worship angels as though they were God This 

worshfni^^'"'^'^'^"" ''^ '^' ^'^^^^^y- Only God Is to be 
worshipped, never a creature, whether it be a man or a 
woman, a saint or an angel. It is just as wrong to give 
worship to an angel as it is to worship an idol of stone 
or a human being. 

THEY ARE NOT OMNIPOTENT 

^lon^^K i" ^* f^ ^"?®'^ ^^^ ^^f* i" ^°'"g from place to 
place, but not omnipresent, wise but not omniscent, so 
too, they are exceedingly powerful but not omnipotent. 
Great and mighty supernatural feats are ascribed to 
angels, but the perrogatives of diety are never theirs They 
cannot create, they cannot redeem, but all their powers 
are only by the special permission and will of God, and 
while they are real persons and individuals just as much 
as we are, they too are limited just as we are; the only 
difference being one of degree and extent of these 
creature limitations. 

From time unknown theologians have discussed the 
question as to the corporality of angels. Do they have 
bodies, or are they only spirits as we usually think of 
them? Now most of you, I am sure, would be inclined 
to answer immediately, "No, angels are spirits and there- 
fore have no bodies at all." However, I am sure that a 
little thought and study of the Bible will definitely reveal 
that angels do have bodies. The difficulty is this, that 
when we think of bodies, we immediately, invariably, 
think of something we can feel and see and apprehend 
with our physical senses, but the only bodies in existence 
are not material or physical or tangible bodies. We know 
that there are also spiritual bodies, intangible, invisible 
to the material senses. God Himself is said to have a 

— 12 — 



form (whatever that form may be). We are told that 
Christ, though He were in the form of God, thought it 
not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of 
no reputation. What this form of God is, no human 
knows. 

The Lord Jesus Himself suggests that angels have 
bodies. When He appeared to the disciples after His 
resurrection they thought they had seen a spirit, and He 
says to them: 

"Handle me, and see; [or a spirit hath not llesh and 

bones, as ye see me have." Luke 24:39. 

Here the Lord Jesus clearly states that angels do not 
have bodies of flesh and bones. But at the same time, He 
does not say that they have no bodies at all, but rather 
infers that their bodies are different, that is, not of flesh 
and bones. Paul in discussing under inspiration, our 
resurrection body teaches the same thing. He says in 1 
Corinthians 15, 

"But God giveth it a body as it has pleased him, 
and to every seed his own body. 

All [lesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind 
of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of 
fishes, and another of birds. 

There are also celestial bodies (heavenly) and 
bodies terrestrial (earthly) : but the glory of the celes- 
tial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another." 

I Cor. 15:38-40. 

There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body. 
A body, therefore, need not be physical at all. How 
many different kinds of bodies God has created for all 
His creatures we do not know now. It may be that on 
the myriads of planets on this universe there are thou- 
sands of other kinds of creatures whom God has made; 
creatures which are neither human nor angelic, neither 
physical nor spiritual. Just because God has not re- 
vealed anything about this does not mean that they do 
not or cannot exist. Personally, I do not believe that all 
of the countless millions and probably billions of planets 
stretching out for millions of light years into space, some 
of them thousands of times bigger than our own earth 

— 13 — 



are uninhabited. Many scientists believe that our nearest 
neighbor, Mars, is inhabited by some sort of intelligent 
beings. God has not been pleased to reveal anything 
about this to us definitely, and I realize that much of this 
is mere speculation, but I have always felt that it will be 
one of the many surprises which God is reserving for us 
when we reach the glory, to see that God's creative power 
did not cease, nor was it exhausted when He made men 
to dwell on earth and angels to dwell in heaven. Now 
I realize, and I hope you will take it in that spirit, that 
this is speculation, but it certainly exalts the Creator to 
even imagine other creatures which we cannot even con- 
ceive of as having been created to bring Him praise and 
glory throughout all eternity. 

THE APPEARANCE OP ANGELS 

The possession of bodies, for angels, seems to be a 
pre-requisite for their work. Angelic beings, both angels 
and demons, seem to be relatively, if not totally powerless 
without these bodies. When they appeared in the Old and 
New Testament they always appeared in bodily, visible 
form, when they communicated with man. In a later 
message when we speak of the fallen angels, we shall find 
out that these demons also once had bodies before they 
fell and rebelled against God. But after these angels 
rebelled against the Almighty, one of their punishments 
was this, that God took their bodies away from them, 
and thereby rendered them powerless, except as God 
permitted them to assume another bodily form. In Gen- 
esis 6, the sons of God (angelic beings) through a vicious 
union with the daughters of men produced a race of in- 
carnated beings called giants. Now the word, giants, in 
Genesis 6 is "nephillim," from the Hebrew word, "Naphal," 
which means "to fall." Giants, then, are fallen ones, 
demons possessing human bodies. So serious was this 
matter that God destroyed the whole population of these 
fallen beings and consigned these wicked spirits into a 
prison house from which they will not be delivered until 
after the Church of Jesus Christ has been raptured. (See 
Jude 6.) 

In Jesus' day demons always appeared in men. The 
man possessed with demons at Gadara is only one of 
many instances which demonstrate that they need bodies 

— 14 — 



in order to operate. You will remember, because of the 
curse of God upon these fallen angels they are disem- 
bodied spirits, and therefore, always are seeking a body 
through which to operate. When Jesus cast them out of 
this man at Gadara they dreaded returning to their dis; 
embodied state so much that they besought the Lord that 
they might enter into a herd of swine. These evil spirits 
would rather live in the bodies of swine than be disem- 
bodied. Again, when Satan came to destroy the Lord he 
needed a body, and he entered into Judas. The Bible 
tells us, "Then entered Satan into Judas," and we know 
furthermore that when Satan makes his last final des- 
parate attempt to destroy the Lord Jesus in the tribula- 
tion period, it will again be through a man, the man of 
sin, the antichrist, the incarnation of the Devil himself. 

So we believe that angels do have bodies. What kind 
of bodies we may not know, but they need be neither 
physical nor spiritual bodies. God is not limited to those 
things which we poor humans can understand. When we 
get to glory we shall know. If it is hard to accept this, 
then let me remind you that it is not easy to imagine 
either what our resurrection bodies will be like. We are 
told that at the resurrection we will receive bodies like 
unto Jesus' body. That was not a body like ours. He 
could leave the tomb without breaking the seal; He could 
be one place now and miles away the next instant; He 
could walk on the water and not sink; He could eat but 
did not have to; He could rise straight up into the air 
into heaven from Mt. Olivet without wings or any other 
propulsion. 

We shall be like Him. How it thrills our hearts as 
we wait for Him! One of these days we shall hear the 
shout, drop off these old, weary, aging, pain-wracked 
bodies like an old garment, and with our new bodies that 
will never grow hungry or cold, that will never thirst nor 
suffer, never be weary nor tired, that shall never be sub- 
ject to passion or sin, we shall rise to meet Him, and all 
the loved ones with Him. How I do thank God for that 
soon coming day. My friend, are you ready for that day? 
If not, then you will never have a redeemed body, but 
will be raised with your old sin-cursed body, to be cast 
into the lake of fire forever. "Believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ and thou shalt be saved." Trust Him now, before 
it is forever too late,

CHAPTER THREE 



"And the angels which kept not their first estate, 
but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in ever' 
lasting chains under darkness unto the judgment o[ 
the great day." Jude 6. 

The angels have homes where they dwell, called in 
this verse in Jude, "habitations." This word, habitation, 
in the Greek means "a dwelling place," or a house. The 
angels, then, according to this verse have dwelling places 
as we might suppose, since they are creatures, and we 
have pointed out they have bodies as well. They, there- 
fore, must have places in which to abide. While tne Bible 
is Clear that heaven is the home of many angels, it does 
not mean that all angels dwell in heaven. The word 
translated "heaven" in Scripture is usually "heavens" in 
the plural, and includes all the three heavens recognized 
in the ifible. There is first of all the atmospheric neaveh 
around the earth. Then there are the astromical, plane- 
tary heavens, containing the countless numbers of stars 
ana planets and other neavenly bodies, and then finally, 
there is the third heaven. Beyond these other two we 
mentioned is this third heaven, called the heaven of 
heavens, and usually referred to as the immediate dwell- 
ing place of God, the place of His Throne, and the orig- 
inal of the pattern of the tabernacle, the Temple which 
God gave to the children of Israel, t'rom this we might 
suppose that it consists of three compartments, the outer 
corresponding with the Court of the Gentiles; the inner 
answering to the Holy Place, and the innermost place 
represented by the Holy of Holies. It is probably in this 
outer court where Satan is said to come before the Al- 
mighty as we have in several passages in Scripture. 

WHERE DO ANGELS DWELL? 

Since angels are the inhabitants of the heavens, we 
may ask which one of these or more are the dwelling 
place, the habitation, of the angels. About the atmos- 
pheric heavens there is no question. Satan is definitely 

— 16 — 



called the Prince of the Power of the air. He was cast 
out of the earth when he sinned, and since he cannot 
dwell in the heaven of heavens, his one place became the 
atmosphere around the earth, and the Bible seems to 
indicate that the air about us is filled with angelic beings 
including these demons. We know also that angels dwell 
in the third heaven, the unfallen angels, for they are ever 
present as standing about the Throne of God and the 
Lamb, ascribing praise and worship to their Creator. But 
do these two places exclude the other heaven as a habita- 
tion of spirit beings ? We refer, of course, to the astrono- 
mical heaven, the stars and the planets and the heavenly 
bodies. While we have no definite statement as to this, 
there is more than a suggestion that many of the planets 
are inhabited, either by these angelic beings or other 
creatures of God not revealed to us as yet. One thing 
we know, however, angels have dwelling places, definite 
places in the Universe, called their particular habitation 
or abode. 

FALLEN ANGELS 

There is a very illuminating and suggestive passage 
touching on this very subject in Isaiah 14. Here we read 
concerning Lucifer, the shining angel who before his fall 
was one of the highest, if not the chief angel of God, who 
rebelled and fell, and we read this of him: 

"How art thou {alien {ram heaven, O Luciler, son 
o[ the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, 
which didst weaken the nations! 

For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into 
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of 
Cod: I will sit also upon the mount o[ the congrega- 
tion, in the sides of the north: 

I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I 
will be like the most High." Isaiah 14:12-14. 

Now please notice two things in this passage defin- 
itely. First, Lucifer had a throne which was not in 
heaven but somewhere else, and this was his dominion. 
Then he was lifted up with pride at his great beauty and 
the power which God had committed to him, and he de- 

— 17 — 



termined to leave this habitation, and notice, rise above 
the clouds, (the atmospheric heaven) and above the stars, 
(the planetary heaven) to the very third heaven, and 
seek to be like unto God and to dethrone his Creator. For 
this rebellion he was cast down from heaven, and became 
Satan. All this is perfectly clear from this chapter. But 
in addition, in Ezekiel 28, we have some more information 
concerning the place, the abode which Satan left to rise 
above the clouds and above the stars. Now will you 
please notice, that since he arose above the clouds and the 
stars, we must infer that his habitation in the beginning 
was below the stars, and the clouds, and that would again 
suggest this earth on which we live today. Ezekiel, in 
chapter 28, is speaking about the King of Tyre who was 
the embodiment of Satan himself, and then he goes beyond 
the King of Tyre, using him as a figure and says con- 
cerning Lucifer who became Satan: 

"Thou sealest up the sun. full of wisdom, and pee- 
led in beauty. 

Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; .... 



Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I 
have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain 
of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst 
of the stones of fire. 

Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that 
thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee." 

Ezekiel 28:12-15 • 

This of course can refer to none other than Lucifer, 
the I'son of the morning," who fell by rebellion against 
Almighty God. Now gathering the many suggestions in 
these passages, we come to this conclusion. Lucifer was 
the great shining angel. He was perfect as he came from 
the hand of God. He dwelt on the earth in Eden which, 
of course, we know was on the earth, and aspired to the 
Throne of God and ascended into heaven with the distinct 
object of rebelling against God. As a result of this re- 
bellion, he was cast out of the earth, he was made a dis- 
embodied spirit, and destined to be finally cast forever 

— 18 — 



into the lake of fire. Now in harmony with this is the 
record of Genesis I. In the first chapter of Genesis I 
we read: 

"In the beginning God creafed the heaven and the 
earth." Gen. 1:1. 

We know from Scripture and from the nature of 
God that this original creation was perfect and without 
flaw, but when we come to the second verse in Genesis I, 
we find quite a different picture, for here we read: 

"And the earth was without form and void; and 

darkness was upon the {ace o[ the deep." 

Here then is a picture of utter ruin, chaos, and dark- 
ness, in sharp contrast to the perfect and complete and 
beautiful earth which God must have created m the be- 
ginning. The Holy Spirit tells us definitely in Isaiah 45 
that God did not create the earth waste and void as we 
find it in Genesis 1:2, but instead, speaking of the earth, 
we read this: 

"God himself that formed the earth and made it; . . 

He created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabit' 

ed." Isaiah 45:18. 

Now pay very close attention to this statement. The 
expression, "He created it not in vain" is the same ex- 
pression which is translated "void" in Genesis 1, verse 2. 
Then notice too that the expression, "without form,' in 
the first part of Genesis is the same word which is trans- 
lated in Isaiah 45 as "to be inhabited." So if we trans- 
late the second verse of Genesis 1 literally we read this: 
"And the earth was void and uninhabited, and darkness 
was upon the face of the deep." But, Isaiah 45 tells us 
distinctly that He did not create it waste, but He created 
it to be inhabited. Now we hope that we have made this 
clear. Isaiah, using the same two identical words as those 
found in Genesis 1, verse 2, says that God did not make 
the earth waste and void, but let me repeat, in Genesis 
1:2 we read that it was waste and void. Remember the 
same two identical words are used. Now since the Bible 
cannot contradict itself, we must seek an explanation, 

— 19 — 



and we have the key in one word in Genesis 1:2. The ex- 
pression, "The earth was without form" should read "The 
earth BECAME without form and void." If then God 
did not create it void and waste and uninhabited, but it 
became so, then something must have happened to make 
It thus. And that of course is our only explanation. In 
the beginning, countless ages ago, make it as many mil- 
lions or billions of years as you want to, God created this 
earth. He made it perfect. On it He placed these angelic 
beings, (now fallen angels) under the leadership of Luci- 
fer, the son of the morning. Then after a time, no one 
knows how long, these beings rebelled, and as a result 
they were cast out of the earth, the earth was cursed, 
God withdrew the light from it, and it became waste and 
void and uninhabited as we find it in Genesis 1:2. How 
long the earth lay this way we do not know, probably 
millions upon millions of years, while the prehistoric 
vegetation decomposed into the oil and the coal and the 
gas which we are using today. That God did destroy the 
earth at this time by a tremendous cataclysmic judgment 
is also borne out by all the findings of geology in corrob- 
oration of the Word of God. 

HOW OLD IS THIS EARTH? 

It was believed up until a few years ago by theolo- 
gians, that this world was only six thousand years old, 
but science vehemently opposed this and claimed it was 
certain it was many millions of years old. Now, of 
course, today we know there is no conflict here at' all. 
The mistake which theologians made was to count the 
creation of the earth from Genesis 1, verse 2, whereas 
they should count it from Genesis 1:1. Man has been 
here only six thousand years, for he was created after 
Genesis 1, verse 2, but the first verse of Genesis goes 
way back beyond that. Between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 
1:2 there is an indefinite period of time, probably count- 
less millions of years. Failing to recognize this, theolo- 
gians took sharp issue with science which claimed the 
age of the world to be much greater. But science also 
made a grievous mistake. They assumed that since the 
earth was millions of years old, therefore, man too must 
be millions of years old, and so they invented the theory 
of evolution, but there is absolutely no record of man 

— 20 — 



upon this earth farther back than six thousand years. 
No authentic remains of any man dating beyond these 
six thousand years have as yet ever been found, of will be 
found, for God created man in His own image on this 
earth six thousand years ago. 

HOW ABOUT DINOSAURS? 

But, says science, we have remains and fossils of 
animals, dinosaurs, brontosaurs, mammoth elephants, 
which we know are more than six thousand years old, in 
fact we know that they are millions of years old. Now 
we gladly grant all of this and admit it readily. But we 
happen to be talking about humans over six thousand 
years old, not the lower animals. Let science produce 
one of these. Those fossil remains of these gigantic mon- 
sters date back, not to Genesis 1, verse 2, but to that pre- 
historic creation in Genesis 1:1, when Lucifer and his 
angels dwelt here upon the earth. The earth then was 
inhabited according to God's original purpose. But then 
millions of years ago sin entered by Satan. The earth 
and its vegetation and the animals were destroyed, and 
today we are digging up those ancient remains. But, 
says another one, there is every evidence that a great ice 
age once covered this whole earth. Again, my friend, you 
are thousands of years late with your discovery. The 
Bible teaches that way back in the distant past the earth 
was a great frozen mass covered with ice. Did you ever 
notice that the Holy Spirit says in the verse that we 
quoted: 

"And the earth was without form and void; and 
DARKNESS WAS UPON THE PACE OP THE 
DEEP.' Gen. 1:2. 

DARKNESS means that there was no light. Natur- 
ally without light, without a sun, heat was shut off, and 
the earth was a frozen mass. It is not stated in so many 
words, because God expects us to use our heads, to know 
that if there is no heat everything must of necessity 
freeze. And so during the interval of many centuries 
and millenniums, maybe millions of years between the 
fall of Satan and the recreation of the world as we have 
it recorded in the first of Genesis, this earth was covered 

— 21 — 



with ice, and therefore the first thing needed when God 
prepared to restore this earth and populate it again was 
to impart heat and melt the frozen mass, and that is just 
exactly what He did, for the first thing God said was 
"LET THERE BE LIGHT." This was the first thing, 
and all of the rest follows in ordter. 

NO CONFLICT WITH SCIENCE 

There never is any conflict between the Bible and the 
findings of true science. I am speaking of true science 
which deals with facts, not guesses and speculations. 
Whenever there is conflict between the Bible and science, 
it is either because we do not understand the Bible cor- 
rectly or else science must be wrong. The right inter- 
pretation of Scripture is always infallible, and if science 
disagrees, you need only to wait, and so-called science will 
prove itself before very long to have been in error. 
Science, "so-called" has changed its views concerning the 
origin of this earth, the evolution of man, and kindred 
subjects so many times, while the Old Book just stands, 
and says without the change of a letter, "In the begin- 
ning God created the heaven and the earth." 

ANGELS DO HAVE HOMES 

Now we have made this digression in order to show 
that angels do have homes and definite abiding places. 
If the angels lived at one time on the earth, is there any 
objection to supposing that they may also inhabit other 
planets? Our earth is only an infinitesimal speck among 
the heavenly bodies. Our nearest planet is the moon, 
240,000 miles away. The next nearest neighbor is Mars, 
37,000,000 miles. Then comes Jupiter and after it Saturn 
is next at 750,000,000 miles. Neptune is 2 billion, five 
hundred thousand miles, and these are just a part of our 
own solar system, and this system is a pinpoint in the 
Universe beyond. The nearest star is 25 billion miles, 
and beyond that millions of others, and on and on and on 
to a distance incomprehensible, with suns and planets 
which make the earth a speck of dust in comparison. Is 
man the only creature inhabiting these vast, uncharted 
worlds? Some day we shall know. Are these bodies the 
habitations of angels? Or are they the many mansions 

— 22 — 



Christ is preparing? How we would like to know, but 
listen, we shall some day. When that glad day arrives 
and we receive our new spiritual bodies, the Lord will 
display to us the hidden glories which our frail, mortal 
minds cannot possibly comprehend now. How I thank 
God that soon we shall see Him, the Creator of all — the 
Saviour, and enter in upon an eternity of surprises and 
revelations. But, oh how sadi for you who are lost to be 
forever banished into outer darkness. Trust Him now, 
and be saved today. 



— 23 — 



CHAPTER FOUR 



The subject of angels is so prominent in the Scrip- 
tures that one feels a total inadequacy in dealing with it 
fully in the brief time that we have in these particular 
messages. We have pointed out in the previous chapters, 
that angels are real creatures, created by God before the 
worlds were made. They have homes and habitations 
in which they dwell. They also possess some kind of a 
body, and they also eat food. In Genesis 18, angels were 
entertained by Abraham in his tent, and he prepared a 
feast for angels and they ate of the meat and the bread 
which he had prepared, but angels also have a very special 
diet. The Bible speaks of "angels' food." In Psalm 78 
we are told what it was. The author of Psalm 78 tells 
us as follows: 

"And had rained down manna upon them to eat, 
and had given them of the corn of heaven. 

Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the 
lull." Psalm 78:24-25. 

The manna on which Israel subsisted for forty years 
in the wilderness is called by God, "angels' food." It 
came down from heaven. God opened up the angels' 
breadbox for His people, for a period of forty years, and 
when we get to heaven we too shall eat angels' food, for 
we read in Revelation 2:17 

To him that overcometh will I give to 

eat o[ the hidden manna." 

Now in the time we have left, we want to speak more 
especially about 

THE MINISTRY OF ANGELS 

When the prophet Elisha was surrounded by the 
armies of Syria in Dothan he prayed to God to open the 
eyes of his servants, and when his eyes were opened he 
beheld the mountain filled with horses and chariots of 
fire, to protect Elisha. If we too could see today that 

— 24 — 



which Elisha saw, we too would be filled with wonder and 
amazement at the marvelous sight, for round about us too 
Eire myriads of angelic beings, ministers of God, unseen 
by us, but nevertheless very real. Angels are always 
busy everywhere. They are the most busy creatures in 
God's universe. They are never said to sleep or to rest, 
but are ceaselessly active day and night. 

Time would utterly fail to ennumerate all of the 
activities of these angelic beings. We have already seen 
that they are ceaselessly active in the life of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, but they are just as active in the life of the 
believer who belongs to Jesus. From the cradle to the 
grave they are our constant attendants, observing all that 
we do and even beyond the grave they attend us. In 
Hebrews 1 we read: 

"Arc they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to 

minister {or them who shall be heirs of salvation?" 

Hebrews 1:14. 

This ministry for the elect of God begins at child- 
hood. Jesus says in Matthew 18:10 concerning little 
children: 

"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little 

ones; for I say unto you. That in heaven their angels 

do always behold the face of my Father which is in 

heaven." 

Now Satan would destroy all God's elect if he only 
could and God would permit, but God has charged these 
angels with the responsibility of protecting His own, or 
we would fall before Satan's onslaught in a moment. 

ALL THROUGH LIFE 

This ministry of angels seems to continue all through 
our lives, all along the way. When God was about to 
destroy Sodom, He made it known to Lot by angels_ in 
order that he might escape from the fire and the brim- 
stone. When Daniel was in the lion's den, he was pro- 
tected by angels, for Daniel himself testifies: 

"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the 
lions' mouths." Daniel 6:22. 

— 25 — 



PETER'S DELIVERANCE 

When Peter too was in prison in the fifth chapter of 
Acts, it was an angel who came to deliver him, for 

"The angel o[ the Lord by night opened the prison 
doors, and brought them forth." Acts 5:19. 

This was repeated later again in the life of Peter 
when once again an angel led him out of the prison. 
What a comforting thought for the believer, to know that 
God has ordered His angels to not only protect us, but to 
deliver us in times of trouble. If we only realize that the 
armies, the hosts of heaven, are really at our disposal, 
we should place less confidence in the arm of flesh and 
physical weapons to defend ourselves. It is not in vain, 
therefore, that we are told that the weapons of our war- 
fare are not carnal, but spiritual. Notice too that angels 
are, 

INTERESTED IN OUR REDEMPTION. 

While angels can never know the joy of being re- 
deemed, they nevertheless are deeply interested in the 
plan of our salvation and redemption. In 1st Peter 1:12 
we are told that they desire to look into this great plan 
of salvation. It speaks to us of the curiosity of the 
angels as they marvel and wonder at God's plan for our 
redemption. Moreover, they rejoice when a soul is 
saved, for Jesus tells us plainly that 

"There is joy in the presence of the angels of God 
over one sinner that repenfeth." Luke 15:10. 

ANGELS TO GUIDE US 

But maybe you say — That was way back in olden 
times — but if you are inclined to believe that angels 
were active only in the Old Testament and ceased in the 
dispensation in which we live, we remind you that the 
New Testament has even more to say about angels than 
the Old Testament. Philip was guided by an angel from 
Samaria to meet the Ethiopian on the way to Gaza. 
Cornelius, the seeker after truth, was visited by an angel 
and told to send for Peter that he might present to him 
the plan of salvation. On Paul's journey to Rome when 

— 26 — 



he was on the way to prison, an angel appeared to assure 
him that no harm would befall the passengers of the 
sinking ship. 

PRESENT AT WORSHIP 

Angels too we are told are present at the worship Ser- 
vices of the people of God in their assemblies and in their 
churches. Paul tells us in his letters in speaking of the 
woman's place and her conduct in the assembly of the 
church, that they are to keep their head covered because 
of the angels. Correctly translated this passage so often 
misunderstood should be, "because of the presence of the 
angels." God has ordered the angels to be present at 
our worship that they may observe our conduct in grati- 
tude to God as we worship Him. 

ANGELS TO CARRY US HOME 
But the most glorious climax of the entire ministry 
of the heavenly angels comes at the time when we shall 
need them the most. I know of no more comforting truth 
in the entire Scripture concerning the angels than their 
ministry to us at the hour of our death, should we die 
before the Lord comes. Remember, when a saint dies, 
his soul and his spirit go directly into heaven, while his 
body is temporarily placed in the grave until the resur- 
rection at the return of Christ. Now will you please re- 
member that in order for the spirit of the saint to go 
into heaven, it is necessary for it to pass through the 
atmosphere, the air which surrounds this earth. But the 
atmosphere surrounding our earth is the particular abode 
of Satan and his fallen angels, the traditional enemies not 
only of Christ, but all who belong to Him. He is called 
in the Scriptures, "The Prince of the Power of the Air." 
We might, therefore, logically expect that the passage 
of the saint at death, from earth to heaven would be 
sharply and vigorously contested by Satan and by His 
angels. It is his last and his final opportunity to harass 
and attack the believer on his final journey home. Were 
it not for the promises of God;, therefore, the saint might 
never even reach heaven, but God has made a wonderful 
provision. There is a special army, a special host of 
angels, whose particular duty it seems to be to escort the 
souls of his people, the saints, at death, into their heaven- 

— 27 — 



ly home and the presence of their Saviour. The Lord 
Jesus Himself assures us in the record of Lazarus and 
the rich man in Luke 16 concerning- this matter: 

And if came to pass that the beggar died, and was 
■carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom." 

Luke 16:22. 

CARRIED BY ANGELS 
Not escorted by angels, but carried by the angels, 
into Abraham's bosom. Notice that carefully. CARRIED 
BY THE ANGELS. What an experience that must have 
been for Lazarus and what an experience it must be for 
all of God's homegoing saints. It almost makes one want 
to die, for it must be a glorious experience to have an 
army of heaven to bring us home. It certainly takes the 
fear of death away from us. Instead of a dreaded ex- 
perience, it will be the most glorious thrill as a fit climax 
to a life of trial and struggle. Carried by the angels. 
We read of the world's great when they come home, how 
the crowds are waiting, the cannons saluting, the flags 
waving, the army marching, and the great man is riding 
in a special car with other great ones, surrounded by 
secret police on every hand and an array of military 
protection. But that, my friend, is nothing compared to 
the thrill of dying, for the believing Christian. To come 
home, to leave these old clods of clay, to be loosed from 
the earth, to say good-bye to all that hinders, and then 
surrounded by heavenly hosts be carried by the angels, 
God's own ministering spirits amid the shouts of triumph 
of the saints in heaven awaiting us and the innumerable 
company of angels, to be ushered into His blessed pres- 
ence, to see Him and hear Him say, "Well done, thou good 
and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." 
When one thinks of this, one may well exclaim with Paul, 
"Oh, death where is thy sting? ,0h grave, where is thy 
victory?" 

IS THIS DYING? 

We ask the question, therefore, "Is this what death 
really is?" "Is this dying for the believer?" Yes, my 

— 28 — 



friend, this is death for them that trust in the Lord Jesus 
Christ. David could say way back in the Old Testament, 

"Yea. though I walk through the valley of the 
shadow of death, I will [ear no evil: for thou art with 
me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." 

Psalm 23:4 

We have the additional information in the New Testa- 
ment that the angels themselves will form a cordon of pro- 
tection round about the saint as he goes off to the glory. 
Oh, you suffering one, torn by the fear of death, this is 
God's picture of your homegoing. You aged ones, almost 
at the end of life, living in the last shadows of the sun- 
set, soon you will hear the approach of the angels, softly 
treading angels, who will gently pick you up, painlessly 
loose the earthly fetters that bind you to this low sphere, 
and up, up, up, up, and up, past suns and stars and 
moons and constellations, up and up into His presence 
until you see Him. 

AND THEN 

And then! Forever these angels shall be our ser- 
vants attending our every wish, granting our every de- 
sire, until we return to receive our new bodies at Jesus' 
second coming amidst the angels as guests. What a 
glorious consummation! Therefore, let trials come. Let 
Satan do his best and his worst. Even in death he can- 
not harm us; even in death there is victory for the be- 
liever. 

BETWIXT AND BETWEEN 

Of course, we know that the blessed hope for the 
believer is not going home by the way of death, but by 
the way of the rapture, and all of us long for that time, 
and hope that we may belong to that generation who 
shall escape death, for death is still an enemy, and that 
we may be found when He comes, and at the shcat and 
the Call of the trumpet, rise to meet Him in the air, 
changed instantaneously, without dying. But the Lord 
has left us this comfort also, that should we have to die 
before that glad and glorious day of His returning, we 
shall have the thrill of knowing, that He who is the 

— 29 — 



conqueror of death has made provision, even for the soul 
of the saint of God when he comes to the last great 
divide. Undoubtedly this is what Paul had in mind when 
he said: 

"Whether we live, therefore, or whether we die, we 
are the Lord's." 

God has provided something good for each of His 
children at the end of the way. Yes, indeed, death is still 
the last enemy, but how we praise God that He has given 
us the victory, even over the last enemy. 

But in closing we also want to mention one other 
thing which we have kept to the last in order that it 
might be served as a warning. To those who are still 
without Christ, those who have never received Christ 
as their personal Saviour, shall find that the angels are 
not only God's ministers, to comfort and to protect and 
to deliver and accompany the saints, but also the mes- 
sengers of God for judgment upon all who reject Him. 
You will recall in the book of Acts that a certain King 
by the name of Herod rejected God and the judgment of 
the Almighty fell upon him. The record is a striking 
example of the ministry of angels in the judgment of the 
wicked. We read in Acts 12: 

"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal ap- 
parel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto 
them. 

And the people gave a shout, saying, If is the voice 
of a god, and not of a man. 

And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, 
because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten 
of worms, and gave up the ghost." Acts 12:21-23. 

And when the Lord comes again it will be through 
the ministry of angels that He will gather the wicked 
together to be cast forever into the lake of fire. Ah, 
my friend, do you realize that you are intimately associ- 
ated w^th angelic beings, either for salvation or for con- 
demnation. Believe the Lord of angels today, receive the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and THOU SHALT BE SAVED.
