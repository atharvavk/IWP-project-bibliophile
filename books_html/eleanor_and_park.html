He’d stopped trying to bring her back.
She only came back when she felt like it, in
dreams and lies and broken-down déjà vu.
Like, he’d be driving to work, and he’d see a
girl with red hair standing on the corner – and
he’d swear, for half a choking moment, that it
was her.
Then he’d see that the girl’s hair was more
blond than red.
And that she was holding a cigarette … And
wearing a Sex Pistols T-shirt.
Eleanor hated the Sex Pistols.
Eleanor …
Standing behind him until he turned his head.
Lying next to him just before he woke up. Making
everyone else seem drabber and flatter and
never good enough.
Eleanor ruining everything.
Eleanor, gone.
He’d stopped trying to bring her back.
AUGUST 1986
CHAPTER 1
Park
XTC was no good for drowning out the morons
at the back of the bus.
Park pressed his headphones into his ears.
Tomorrow he was going to bring Skinny
Puppy or the Misfits. Or maybe he’d make a special
bus tape with as much screaming and wailing
on it as possible.
He could get back to New Wave in November,
after he got his driver’s license. His parents
had already said Park could have his mom’s Impala,
and he’d been saving up for a new tape
deck. Once he started driving to school, he could
listen to whatever he wanted or nothing at all,
and he’d get to sleep in an extra twenty minutes.
‘That doesn’t exist,’ somebody shouted behind
him.
‘It so fucking does,’ Steve shouted back.
‘Drunken-monkey style, man, it’s a real fucking
thing. You can kill somebody with it …’
‘You’re full of shit.’
‘You’re full of shit,’ Steve said. ‘Park! Hey,
Park.’
Park heard him, but didn’t answer. Sometimes,
if you ignored Steve for a minute, he
moved onto someone else. Knowing that was 80
percent of surviving with Steve as your neighbor.
The other 20 percent was just keeping your head
down …
Which Park had momentarily forgotten. A
ball of paper hit him in the back of the head.
‘Those were my Human Growth and Development
notes, dicklick,’ Tina said.
‘I’m sorry, baby,’ Steve said. ‘I’ll teach you
all about human growth and development. What
do you need to know?’
11/593
‘Teach her drunken-monkey style,’ somebody
said.
‘PARK!’ Steve shouted.
Park pulled down his headphones and turned
to the back of the bus. Steve was holding court in
the last seat. Even sitting, his head practically
touched the roof. Steve always looked like he
was surrounded by doll furniture. He’d looked
like a grown man since the seventh grade, and
that was before he grew a full beard. Slightly
before.
Sometimes Park wondered if Steve was with
Tina because she made him look even more like
a monster. Most of the girls from the Flats were
small, but Tina couldn’t be five feet. Massive
hair, included.
Once, back in middle school, some guy had
tried to give Steve shit about how he better not
get Tina pregnant because if he did, his giant babies
would kill her. ‘They’ll bust out of her stomach
like in Aliens,’ the guy said. Steve broke his
little finger on the guy’s face.
12/593
When Park’s dad heard, he said, ‘Somebody
needs to teach that Murphy kid how to make a
fist.’ But Park hoped nobody would. The guy
Steve hit couldn’t open his eyes for a week.
Park tossed Tina her balled-up homework.
She caught it.
‘Park,’ Steve said, ‘tell Mikey about drunkenmonkey
karate.’
‘I don’t know anything about it.’ Park
shrugged.
‘But it exists, right?’
‘I guess I’ve heard of it.’
‘There,’ Steve said. He looked for something
to throw at Mikey, but couldn’t find anything. He
pointed instead. ‘I fucking told you.’
‘What the fuck does Sheridan know about
kung fu?’ Mikey said.
‘Are you retarded?’ Steve said. ‘His mom’s
Chinese.’
Mikey looked at Park carefully. Park smiled
and narrowed his eyes. ‘Yeah, I guess I see it,’
13/593
Mikey said. ‘I always thought you were
Mexican.’
‘Shit, Mikey,’ Steve said, ‘you’re such a
fucking racist.’
‘She’s not Chinese,’ Tina said. ‘She’s
Korean.’
‘Who is?’ Steve asked.
‘Park’s mom.’
Park’s mom had been cutting Tina’s hair
since grade school. They both had the exact same
hairstyle, long spiral perms with tall, feathered
bangs.
‘She’s fucking hot is what she is,’ Steve said,
cracking himself up. ‘No offense, Park.’
Park managed another smile and slunk back
into his seat, putting his headphones back on and
cranking up the volume. He could still hear Steve
and Mikey, four seats behind him.
‘But what’s the fucking point?’ Mikey asked.
‘Dude, would you want to fight a drunk monkey?
They’re fucking huge. Like Every Which
14/593
Way But Loose, man. Imagine that bastard losing
his shit on you.’
Park noticed the new girl at about the same
time everybody else did. She was standing at the
front of the bus, next to the first available seat.
There was a kid sitting there by himself, a
freshman. He put his bag down on the seat beside
him, then looked the other way. All down the
aisle, anybody who was sitting alone moved to
the edge of their seat. Park heard Tina snicker;
she lived for this stuff.
The new girl took a deep breath and stepped
farther down the aisle. Nobody would look at her.
Park tried not to, but it was kind of a train wreck/
eclipse situation.
The girl just looked like exactly the sort of
person this would happen to.
Not just new – but big and awkward. With
crazy hair, bright red on top of curly. And she
was dressed like … like she wanted people to
look at her. Or maybe like she didn’t get what a
mess she was. She had on a plaid shirt, a man’s
15/593
shirt, with half a dozen weird necklaces hanging
around her neck and scarves wrapped around her
wrists. She reminded Park of a scarecrow or one
of the trouble dolls his mom kept on her dresser.
Like something that wouldn’t survive in the wild.
The bus stopped again, and a bunch more
kids got on. They pushed past the girl, knocking
into her, and dropped into their own seats.
That was the thing – everybody on the bus
already had a seat. They’d all claimed one on the
first day of school. People like Park who were
lucky enough to have a whole seat to themselves
weren’t going to give that up now. Especially not
for someone like this.
Park looked back up at the girl. She was just
standing there.
‘Hey, you,’ the bus driver yelled, ‘sit down.’
The girl started moving toward the back of
the bus. Right into the belly of the beast. God,
Park thought, stop. Turn around. He could feel
Steve and Mikey licking their chops as she got
closer. He tried again to look away.
16/593
Then the girl spotted an empty seat just
across from Park. Her face lit with relief, and she
hurried toward it.
‘Hey,’ Tina said sharply.
The girl kept moving.
‘Hey,’ Tina said, ‘Bozo.’
Steve started laughing. His friends fell in a
few seconds behind him.
‘You can’t sit there,’ Tina said. ‘That’s
Mikayla’s seat.’
The girl stopped and looked up at Tina, then
looked back at the empty seat.
‘Sit down,’ the driver bellowed from the
front.
‘I have to sit somewhere,’ the girl said to
Tina in a firm, calm voice.
‘Not my problem,’ Tina snapped. The bus
lurched, and the girl rocked back to keep from
falling. Park tried to turn the volume up on his
Walkman, but it was already all the way up. He
looked back at the girl; it looked like she was
starting to cry.
17/593
Before he’d even decided to do it, Park
scooted toward the window.
‘Sit down,’ he said. It came out angrily. The
girl turned to him, like she couldn’t tell whether
he was another jerk or what. ‘Jesus-fuck,’ Park
said softly, nodding to the space next to him,
‘just sit down.’
The girl sat down. She didn’t say anything –
thank God, she didn’t thank him – and she left
six inches of space on the seat between them.
Park turned toward the Plexiglas window and
waited for a world of suck to hit the fan.
18/593
CHAPTER 2
Eleanor
Eleanor considered her options:
1. She could walk home from school. Pros: Exercise,
color in her cheeks, time to herself. Cons:
She didn’t know her new address yet, or even
the general direction to start walking.
2. She could call her mom and ask for a ride.
Pros: Lots. Cons: Her mom didn’t have a
phone. Or a car.
3. She could call her dad. Ha.
4. She could call her grandma. Just to say hi.
She was sitting on the concrete steps at the front
of the school, staring out at the row of yellow
buses. Her bus was right there. No. 666.
Even if Eleanor could avoid the bus today,
even if her fairy godmother showed up with a
pumpkin carriage, she’d still have to find a way
to get back to school tomorrow morning.
And it’s not like the devil-kids on the bus
were going to wake up on the other side of their
beds tomorrow. Seriously. It wouldn’t surprise
Eleanor if they unhinged their jaws the next time
she saw them. That girl in the back with the
blond hair and the acid-washed jacket? You
could practically see the horns hidden in her
bangs. And her boyfriend was possibly a member
of the Nephilim.
That girl – all of them – hated Eleanor before
they’d even laid eyes on her. Like they’d been
hired to kill her in a past life.
Eleanor couldn’t tell if the Asian kid who finally
let her sit down was one of them, or whether
he was just really stupid. (But not stupid-stupid
… He was in two of Eleanor’s honors
classes.)
20/593
Her mom had insisted that the new school put
Eleanor in honors classes. She’d freaked when
she saw how bad Eleanor’s grades were from last
year in the ninth grade. ‘This can’t be a surprise
to you, Mrs Douglas,’ the counselor said. Ha,
Eleanor thought, you’d be surprised what could
be a surprise at this point.
Whatever. Eleanor could stare at the clouds
just as easily in honors classes. There were just as
many windows.
If she ever even came back to this school.
If she ever even got home.
Eleanor couldn’t tell her mom about the bus
situation anyway because her mom had already
said that Eleanor didn’t have to ride the bus. Last
night, when she was helping Eleanor unpack …
‘Richie said he’ll take you,’ her mom said.
‘It’s on his way to work.’
‘Is he going to make me ride in the back of
his truck?’
‘He’s trying to make peace, Eleanor. You
promised that you’d try, too.’
21/593
‘It’s easier for me to make peace from a
distance.’
‘I told him you were ready to be part of this
family.’
‘I’m already part of this family. I’m like a
charter member.’
‘Eleanor,’ her mom said. ‘Please.’
‘I’ll just ride the bus,’ Eleanor had said. ‘It’s
not a big deal. I’ll meet people.’
Ha, Eleanor thought now. Giant, dramatic ha.
Her bus was going to leave soon. A few of
the other buses were already pulling away. Somebody
ran down the steps next to Eleanor and accidentally
kicked her bag. She pulled it out of the
way and started to say sorry – but it was that stupid
Asian kid, and he frowned when he saw that
it was her. She frowned right back at him, and he
ran ahead.
Oh, fine, Eleanor thought. The children of
hell shan’t go hungry on my watch.
22/593
CHAPTER 3
Park
She didn’t talk to him on the ride home.
Park had spent all day trying to think of how
to get away from the new girl. He’d have to
switch seats. That was the only answer. But
switch to what seat? He didn’t want to force himself
on somebody else. And even the act of
switching seats would catch Steve’s attention.
Park had expected Steve to start in on him as
soon he let the girl sit down, but Steve had gone
right back to talking about kung fu again. Park,
by the way, knew plenty about kung fu. Because
his dad was obsessed with martial arts, not because
his mom was Korean. Park and his little
brother, Josh, had been taking taekwando since
they could walk.
Switch seats, how …?
He could probably find a seat up front with
the freshmen, but that would be a spectacular
show of weakness. And he almost hated to think
about leaving the weird new girl at the back of
the bus by herself.
He hated himself for thinking like this.
If his dad knew he was thinking like this,
he’d call Park a pussy. Out loud, for once. If his
grandma knew, she’d smack him on the back of
the head. ‘Where are you manners?’ she’d say.
‘Is that any way to treat somebody who’s down
on her luck?’
But Park didn’t have any luck – or status – to
spare on that dumb redhead. He had just enough
to keep himself out of trouble. And he knew it
was crappy, but he was kind of grateful that
people like that girl existed. Because people like
Steve and Mikey and Tina existed, too, and they
needed to be fed. If it wasn’t that redhead, it was
going to be somebody else. And if it wasn’t
somebody else, it was going to be Park.
24/593
Steve had let it go this morning, but he
wouldn’t keep letting it go …
Park could hear his grandma again. ‘Seriously,
son, you’re giving yourself a stomach ache
because you did something nice while other
people were watching?’
It wasn’t even that nice, Park thought. He’d
let the girl sit down, but he’d sworn at her. When
she showed up in his English class that afternoon,
it felt like she was there to haunt him …
‘Eleanor,’ Mr Stessman said. ‘What a powerful
name. It’s a queen’s name, you know.’
‘It’s the name of the fat Chipette,’ somebody
behind Park whispered. Somebody else laughed.
Mr Stessman gestured to an empty desk up
front.
‘We’re reading poetry today, Eleanor,’ Mr
Stessman said. ‘Dickinson. Perhaps you’d like to
get us started.’
Mr Stessman opened her book to the right
page and pointed. ‘Go ahead,’ he said, ‘clear and
loud. I’ll tell you when to stop.’
25/593
The new girl looked at Mr Stessman like she
hoped he was kidding. When it was clear that he
wasn’t – he almost never was – she started to
read.
‘I had been hungry all the years,’ she read. A
few kids laughed. Jesus, Park thought, only Mr
Stessman would make a chubby girl read a poem
about eating on her first day of class.
‘Carry on, Eleanor,’ Mr Stessman said.
She started over, which Park thought was a
terrible idea.
‘I had been hungry all the years,’ she said,
louder this time.
‘My noon had come, to dine,
‘I, trembling, drew the table near,
‘And touched the curious wine.
‘T’was this on tables I had seen,
‘When turning, hungry, lone,
‘I looked in windows, for the wealth
‘I could not hope to own.’
26/593
Mr Stessman didn’t stop her, so she read the
whole poem in that cool, defiant voice. The same
voice she’d used on Tina.
‘That was wonderful,’ Mr Stessman said
when she was done. He was beaming. ‘Just wonderful.
I hope you’ll stay with us, Eleanor, at
least until we do Medea. That’s a voice that arrives
on a chariot drawn by dragons.’
When the girl showed up in history, Mr
Sanderhoff didn’t make a scene. But he did say,
‘Ah. Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine,’ when she
handed him her paperwork. She sat down a few
rows ahead of Park and, as far as he could tell,
spent the whole period staring at the sun.
Park couldn’t think of a way to get rid of her
on the bus. Or a way to get rid of himself. So he
put his headphones on before the girl sat down
and turned the volume all the way up.
Thank God she didn’t try to talk to him.
27/593
CHAPTER 4
Eleanor
She got home that afternoon before all the little
kids, which was good because she wasn’t ready
to see them again. It had been such a freak show
when she’d walked in last night …
Eleanor had spent so much time thinking
about what it would be like to finally come home
and how much she missed everybody – she
thought they’d throw her a ticker-tape parade.
She thought it would be a big hugfest.
But when Eleanor walked in the house, it was
like her siblings didn’t recognize her.
Ben just glanced at her, and Maisie – Maisie
was sitting on Richie’s lap. Which would have
made Eleanor throw right up if she hadn’t just
promised her mom that she’d be on her best behavior
for the rest of her life.
Only Mouse ran to hug Eleanor. She picked
him up gratefully. He was five now, and heavy.
‘Hey, Mouse,’ she said. They’d called him
that since he was a baby, she couldn’t remember
why. He reminded her more of a big, sloppy
puppy – always excited, always trying to jump
into your lap.
‘Look, Dad, it’s Eleanor,’ Mouse said, jumping
down. ‘Do you know Eleanor?’
Richie pretended not to hear. Maisie watched
and sucked her thumb. Eleanor hadn’t seen her
do that in years. She was eight now, but with her
thumb in her mouth, she looked just like a baby.
The baby wouldn’t remember Eleanor at all.
He’d be two … There he was, sitting on the floor
with Ben. Ben was eleven. He stared at the wall
behind the TV.
Their mom carried the duffel bag with Eleanor’s
stuff into a bedroom off the living room, and
Eleanor followed her. The room was tiny, just big
29/593
enough for a dresser and some bunk beds. Mouse
ran into the room after them. ‘You get the top
bunk,’ he said, ‘and Ben has to sleep on the floor
with me. Mom already told us, and Ben started to
cry.’
‘Don’t worry about that,’ their mom said
softly. ‘We all just have to readjust.’
There wasn’t room in this room to readjust.
(Which Eleanor decided not to mention.) She
went to bed as soon as she could, so she wouldn’t
have to go back out to the living room.
When she woke up in the middle of the night,
all three of her brothers were asleep on the floor.
There was no way to get up without stepping on
one of them, and she didn’t even know where the
bathroom was …
She found it. There were only five rooms in
the house, and the bathroom just barely counted.
It was attached to the kitchen – like literally attached,
without a door. This house was designed
by cave trolls, Eleanor thought. Somebody,
30/593
probably her mom, had hung a flowered sheet
between the refrigerator and the toilet.
When she got home from school, Eleanor let
herself in with her new key. The house was possibly
even more depressing in daylight – dingy
and bare – but at least Eleanor had the place, and
her mom, to herself.
It was weird to come home and see her mom,
just standing in the kitchen, like … like normal.
She was making soup, chopping onions. Eleanor
felt like crying.
‘How was school?’ her mom asked.
‘Fine,’ Eleanor said.
‘Did you have a good first day?’
‘Sure. I mean, yeah, it was just school.’
‘Will you have a lot of catching up to do?’
‘I don’t think so.’
Her mom wiped her hands on the back of her
jeans and tucked her hair behind her ears, and
Eleanor was struck, for the ten-thousandth time,
by how beautiful she was.
31/593
When Eleanor was a little girl, she’d thought
her mom looked like a queen, like the star of
some fairy tale.
Not a princess – princesses are just pretty.
Eleanor’s mother was beautiful. She was tall and
stately, with broad shoulders and an elegant
waist. All of her bones seemed more purposeful
than other people’s. Like they weren’t just there
to hold her up, they were there to make a point.
She had a strong nose and a sharp chin, and
her cheekbones were high and thick. You’d look
at Eleanor’s mom and think she must be carved
into the prow of a Viking ship somewhere or
maybe painted on the side of a plane …
Eleanor looked a lot like her.
But not enough.
Eleanor looked like her mother through a fish
tank. Rounder and softer. Slurred. Where her
mother was statuesque, Eleanor was heavy.
Where her mother was finely drawn, Eleanor was
smudged.
32/593
After five kids, her mother had breasts and
hips like a woman in a cigarette ad. At sixteen,
Eleanor was already built like she ran a medieval
pub.
She had too much of everything and too little
height to hide it. Her breasts started just below
her chin, her hips were … a parody. Even her
mom’s hair, long and wavy and auburn, was a
more legitimate version of Eleanor’s bright red
curls.
Eleanor put her hand to her head selfconsciously.
‘I have something to show you,’ her mom
said, covering the soup, ‘but I didn’t want to do it
in front of the little kids. Here, come on.’
Eleanor followed her into the kids’ bedroom.
Her mom opened the closet and took out a stack
of towels and a laundry basket full of socks.
‘I couldn’t bring all your things when we
moved,’ she said. ‘Obviously we don’t have as
much room here as we had in the old house …’
She reached into the closet and pulled out a black
33/593
plastic garbage bag. ‘But I packed as much as I
could.’
She handed Eleanor the bag and said, ‘I’m
sorry about the rest.’
Eleanor had assumed that Richie threw all her
stuff in the trash a year ago, ten seconds after
he’d kicked her out. She took the bag in her arms.
‘It’s okay,’ she said. ‘Thanks.’
Her mom reached out and touched Eleanor’s
shoulder, just for a second. ‘The little kids will be
home in twenty minutes or so,’ she said, ‘and
we’ll eat dinner around 4:30. I like to have
everything settled before Richie comes home.’
Eleanor nodded. She opened the bag as soon
as her mom left the room. She wanted to see
what was still hers …
The first thing she recognized were the paper
dolls. They were loose in the bag and wrinkled; a
few were marked with crayons. It had been years
since Eleanor had played with them, but she was
still happy to see them there. She pressed them
flat and laid them in a pile.
34/593
Under the dolls were books, a dozen or so
that her mother must have grabbed at random;
she wouldn’t have known which were Eleanor’s
favorites. Eleanor was glad to see Garp and
Watership Down. It sucked that Oliver’s Story
had made the cut, but Love Story hadn’t. And
Little Men was there, but not Little Women or
Jo’s Boys.
There was a bunch more papers in the bag.
She’d had a file cabinet in her old room, and it
looked like her mom had grabbed most of the
folders. Eleanor tried to get everything into a neat
stack, all the report cards and school pictures and
letters from pen pals.
She wondered where the rest of the stuff from
the old house had ended up. Not just her stuff,
but everybody’s. Like the furniture and the toys,
and all of her mom’s plants and paintings. Her
grandma’s Danish wedding plates … The little
red ‘Uff da!’ horse that always used to hang
above the sink.
35/593
Maybe it was packed away somewhere.
Maybe her mom was hoping the cave-troll house
was just temporary.
Eleanor was still hoping that Richie was just
temporary.
At the bottom of the black trash bag was a
box. Her heart jumped a little when she saw it.
Her uncle in Minnesota used to send her family a
Fruit of the Month Club membership every
Christmas, and Eleanor and her brothers and sister
would always fight over the boxes that the
fruit came in. It was stupid, but they were good
boxes – solid, with nice lids. This one was a
grapefruit box, soft from wear at the edges.
Eleanor opened it carefully. Nothing inside
had been touched. There was her stationery, her
colored pencils and her Prismacolor markers (another
Christmas present from her uncle). There
was a stack of promotional cards from the mall
that still smelled like expensive perfumes. And
there was her Walkman. Untouched. Un-batteried,
too, but nevertheless, there. And where there
36/593
was a Walkman, there was the possibility of
music.
Eleanor let her head fall over the box. It
smelled like Chanel No. 5 and pencil shavings.
She sighed.
There wasn’t anything to do with her recovered
belongings once she’d sorted through
them – there wasn’t even room in the dresser for
Eleanor’s clothes. So she set aside the box and
the books, and carefully put everything else back
in the garbage bag. Then she pushed the bag back
as far as she could on the highest shelf in the
closet, behind the towels and a humidifier.
She climbed onto her bunk and found a scraggly
old cat napping there. ‘Shoo,’ Eleanor said,
shoving him. The cat leaped to the floor and out
the bedroom door.
37/593
CHAPTER 5
Park
Mr Stessman was making them all memorize a
poem, whatever poem they wanted. Well,
whatever poem they picked.
‘You’re going to forget everything else I
teach you,’ Mr Stessman said, petting his mustache.
‘Everything. Maybe you’ll remember that
Beowulf fought a monster. Maybe you’ll remember
that “To be or not to be” is Hamlet, not
Macbeth …
‘But everything else? Forget about it.’
He was slowly walking up and down each
aisle. Mr Stessman loved this kind of stuff –
theater in the round. He stopped next to Park’s
desk and leaned in casually with his hand on the
back of Park’s chair. Park stopped drawing and
sat up straight. He couldn’t draw anyway.
‘So, you’re going to memorize a poem,’ Mr
Stessman continued, pausing a moment to smile
down at Park like Gene Wilder in the chocolate
factory.
‘Brains love poetry. It’s sticky stuff. You’re
going to memorize this poem, and five years
from now, we’re going to see each other at the
Village Inn, and you’ll say, “Mr Stessman, I still
remember ‘The Road Not Taken!’ Listen …
‘Two roads diverged in a yellow wood …’”’
He moved on to the next desk. Park relaxed.
‘Nobody gets to pick “The Road Not Taken,”
by the way, I’m sick to death of it. And no Shel
Silverstein. He’s grand, but you’ve graduated.
We’re all adults here. Choose an adult poem …
‘Choose a romantic poem, that’s my advice.
You’ll get the most use out of it.’
He walked by the new girl’s desk, but she
didn’t turn away from the window.
39/593
‘Of course, it’s up to you. You may choose
“A Dream Deferred” – Eleanor?’ She turned
blankly. Mr Stessman leaned in. ‘You may
choose it, Eleanor. It’s poignant and it’s truth.
But how often will you get to roll that one out?
‘No. Choose a poem that speaks to you.
Choose a poem that will help you speak to
someone else.’
Park planned to choose a poem that rhymed,
so it would be easier to memorize. He liked Mr
Stessman, he really did – but he wished he’d dial
it back a few notches. Whenever he worked the
room like this, Park got embarrassed for him.
‘We meet tomorrow in the library,’ Mr Stessman
said, back at his desk. ‘Tomorrow, we’re
gathering rosebuds.’
The bell rang. On cue.
40/593
CHAPTER 6
Eleanor
‘Watch it, raghead.’
Tina pushed roughly past Eleanor and
climbed onto the bus.
She had everybody else in their gym class
calling Eleanor Bozo, but Tina had already
moved on to Raghead and Bloody Mary. ‘Cuz it
looks like your whole head is on the rag,’ she’d
explained today in the locker room.
It made sense that Tina was in Eleanor’s gym
class – because gym was an extension of hell,
and Tina was definitely a demon. A weird, miniature
demon. Like a toy demon. Or a teacup. And
she had a whole gang of lesser demons, all
dressed in matching gymsuits.
Actually, everyone wore matching gymsuits.
At Eleanor’s old school, she’d thought it had
sucked that they had to wear gym shorts. (Eleanor
hated her legs even more than she hated the
rest of her body.) But at North they had to wear
gymsuits. Polyester onesies. The bottom was red,
and the top was red-and-white striped, and it all
zipped up the front.
‘Red isn’t your color, Bozo,’ Tina had said
the first time Eleanor suited up. The other girls
all laughed, even the black girls, who hated Tina.
Laughing at Eleanor was Dr King’s mountain.
After Tina pushed past her, Eleanor took her
time getting on the bus – but she still got to her
seat before that stupid Asian kid. Which meant
she’d have to get up to let him have his spot by
the window. Which would be awkward. It was all
awkward. Every time the bus hit a pothole,
Eleanor practically fell in the guy’s lap.
Maybe somebody else on the bus would drop
out or die or something and she’d be able move
away from him.
42/593
At least he didn’t ever talk to her. Or look at
her.
At least she didn’t think he did; Eleanor never
looked at him.
Sometimes she looked at his shoes. He had
cool shoes. And sometimes she looked to see
what he was reading …
Always comic books.
Eleanor never brought anything to read on the
bus. She didn’t want Tina, or anybody else, to
catch her with her head down.
Park
It felt wrong to sit next to somebody every day
and not talk to her. Even if she was weird. (Jesus,
was she weird. Today she was dressed like a
Christmas tree, with all this stuff pinned to her
clothes, shapes cut out of fabric, ribbon …) The
ride home couldn’t go fast enough. Park couldn’t
wait to get away from her, away from everybody.
‘Dude, where’s your dobak?’
43/593
He was trying to eat dinner alone in his room,
but his little brother wouldn’t let him. Josh stood
in the doorway, already dressed for taekwando
and inhaling a chicken leg.
‘Dad’s going to be here, like now,’ Josh said
through the drumstick, ‘and he’s gonna shit if
you’re not ready.’
Their mom came up behind Josh and
thumped him on the head. ‘Don’t cuss, dirty
mouth.’ She had to reach up to do it. Josh was his
father’s son; he was already at least seven inches
taller than their mom – and three inches taller
than Park.
Which sucked.
Park pushed Josh out the door and slammed
it. So far, Park’s strategy for maintaining his
status as older brother despite their growing size
differential was to pretend he could still kick
Josh’s ass.
He could still beat him at taekwando – but
only because Josh got impatient with any sport
where his size wasn’t an obvious advantage. The
44/593
high school football coach had already started
coming to Josh’s Peewee games.
Park changed into his dobak, wondering if he
was going to have to start wearing Josh’s handme-
downs pretty soon. Maybe he could take a
Sharpie to all Josh’s Husker football T-shirts and
make them say Husker Dü. Or maybe it wouldn’t
even be an issue – Park might never get any taller
than five foot four. He might never grow out of
the clothes he had now.
He put on his Chuck Taylors and took his
dinner into the kitchen, eating over the counter.
His mom was trying to get gravy out of Josh’s
white jacket with a washcloth.
‘Mindy?’
That’s how Park’s dad came home every
night, like the dad in a sit-com. (‘Lucy?’) And his
mom would call out from wherever she was, ‘In
here!’
Except she said it, ‘In hee-ya!’ Because she
was apparently never going to stop sounding like
she just got here yesterday from Korea.
45/593
Sometimes Park thought she kept the accent on
purpose, because his dad liked it. But his mom
tried so hard to fit in in every other way … If she
could sound like she grew up right around the
corner, she would.
His dad barreled into the kitchen and scooped
his mom into his arms. They did this every night,
too. Full-on make-out sessions, no matter who
was around. It was like watching Paul Bunyan
make out with one of those It’s a Small World
dolls.
Park grabbed his brother’s sleeve. ‘Come on,
let’s go.’ They could wait in the Impala. Their
dad would be out in a minute, as soon as he’d
changed into his giant dobak.
Eleanor
She still couldn’t get used to eating dinner so
early.
When did this all start? In the old house,
they’d all eaten together, even Richie. Eleanor
46/593
wasn’t complaining about not having to eat with
Richie … But now it was like their mom wanted
them all out of the way before he came home.
She even made him a totally different dinner.
The kids would get grilled cheese, and Richie
would get steak. Eleanor wasn’t complaining
about the grilled cheese either – it was a nice
break from bean soup, and beans and rice, and
huevos y frijoles …
After dinner, Eleanor usually disappeared into
her room to read, but the little kids always
went outside. What were they going to do when it
got cold – and when it started getting dark early?
Would they all hide in the bedroom? It was
crazy. Diary of Anne Frank crazy.
Eleanor climbed up onto her bunk bed and
got out her stationery box. That dumb gray cat
was sleeping in her bed again. She pushed him
off.
She opened the grapefruit box and flipped
through her stationery. She kept meaning to write
letters to her friends from her old school. She
47/593
hadn’t gotten to say goodbye to anybody when
she left. Her mom had shown up out of the blue
and pulled Eleanor out of class, all ‘Get your
things, you’re coming home.’
Her mom had been so happy.
And Eleanor had been so happy.
They went straight to North to get Eleanor registered,
then stopped at Burger King on the way
to the new house. Her mom kept squeezing
Eleanor’s hand … Eleanor had pretended not to
notice the bruises on her mom’s wrist.
The bedroom door opened, and her little sister
walked in, carrying the cat.
‘Mom wants you to leave the door open,’
Maisie said, ‘for the breeze.’ Every window in
the house was open, but there didn’t seem to be
any breeze. With the door open, Eleanor could
just see Richie sitting on the couch. She scooted
down the bed until she couldn’t.
‘What are you doing?’ Maisie asked.
‘Writing a letter.’
‘To who?’
48/593
‘I don’t know yet.’
‘Can I come up?’
‘No.’ For the moment, all Eleanor could think
about was keeping her box safe. She didn’t want
Maisie to see the colored pencils and clean paper.
Plus, part of her still wanted to punish Maisie for
sitting in Richie’s lap.
That never would have happened before.
Before Richie kicked Eleanor out, all the kids
were allied against him. Maybe Eleanor had
hated him the most, and the most openly – but
they were all on her side, Ben and Maisie, even
Mouse. Mouse used to steal Richie’s cigarettes
and hide them. And Mouse was the one they’d
send to knock on their mom’s door when they
heard bedsprings …
When it was worse than bedsprings, when it
was shouting or crying, they’d huddle together,
all five of them, on Eleanor’s bed. (They’d all
had their own beds in the old house.)
49/593
Maisie sat at Eleanor’s right hand then. When
Mouse cried, when Ben’s face went blank and
dreamy, Maisie and Eleanor would lock eyes.
‘I hate him,’ Eleanor would say.
‘I hate him so much I wish he was dead,’
Maisie would answer.
‘I hope he falls off a ladder at work.’
‘I hope he gets hit by a truck.’
‘A garbage truck.’
‘Yeah,’ Maisie would say, gritting her teeth,
‘and all the garbage will fall on his dead body.’
‘And then a bus will run him over.’
‘Yeah.’
‘I hope I’m on it.’
Maisie put the cat back on Eleanor’s bed. ‘It
likes to sleep up there,’ she said.
‘Do you call him Dad, too?’ Eleanor asked.
‘He is our dad now,’ Maisie said.
Eleanor woke up in the middle of the night. Richie
had fallen asleep in the living room with the
TV on. She didn’t breathe on the way to the bathroom
and was too scared to flush the toilet. When
50/593
she got back to her room, she closed the door.
Fuck the breeze.
51/593
CHAPTER 7
Park
‘I’m going to ask Kim out,’ Cal said.
‘Don’t ask Kim out,’ Park said.
‘Why not?’ They were sitting in the library,
and they were supposed to be looking for poems.
Cal had already picked out something short about
a girl named Julia and the ‘liquefaction of her
clothes.’ (‘Crass,’ Park said. ‘It can’t be crass,’
Cal argued. ‘It’s three-hundred years old.’)
‘Because she’s Kim,’ Park said. ‘You can’t
ask her out. Look at her.’
Kim was sitting at the next table over with
two other preppy girls.
‘Look at her,’ Cal said, ‘she’s a Betty.’
‘Jesus,’ Park said. ‘You sound so stupid.’
‘What? That’s a thing. A Betty is a thing.’
‘But you got it from Thrasher or something,
right?’
‘That’s how people learn new words, Park’ –
Cal tapped a book of poetry – ‘reading.’
‘You’re trying too hard.’
‘She’s a Betty,’ Cal said, nodding at Kim and
getting a Slim Jim out of his backpack.
Park looked at Kim again. She had bobbed
blond hair and hard, curled bangs, and she was
the only kid in school with a Swatch. Kim was
one of those people who never wrinkled … She
wouldn’t make eye contact with Cal. She’d be
afraid he’d leave a stain.
‘This is my year,’ Cal said. ‘I’m getting a
girlfriend.’
‘But probably not Kim.’
‘Why not Kim? You think I need to aim
lower?’
Park looked up at him. Cal wasn’t a badlooking
guy. He had kind of a tall Barney Rubble
thing going on … He already had pieces of Slim
Jim caught in his front teeth.
53/593
‘Aim elsewhere,’ Park said.
‘Screw that,’ Cal said, ‘I’m starting at the top.
And I’m getting you a girl, too.’
‘Thanks, but no thanks,’ Park said.
‘Double-dating,’ Cal said.
‘No.’
‘In the Impala.’
‘Don’t get your hopes up.’ Park’s dad had decided
to be a fascist about Park’s driver’s license;
he’d announced last night that Park had to learn
to drive a stick first. Park opened another book of
poetry. It was all about war. He closed it.
‘Now there’s a girl who might want a piece
of you,’ Cal said. ‘Looks like somebody’s got
jungle fever.’
‘That isn’t even the right kind of racist,’ Park
said, looking up. Cal was nodding toward the far
corner of the library. The new girl was sitting
there, staring right at them.
‘She’s kind of big,’ Cal said, ‘but the Impala
is a spacious automobile.’
54/593
‘She’s not looking at me. She’s just staring,
she does that. Watch.’ Park waved at the girl, but
she didn’t blink.
He’d only made eye contact with her once
since her first day on the bus. It was last week, in
history, and she’d practically gouged out his eyes
with hers.
If you don’t want people to look at you, Park
had thought at the time, don’t wear fishing lures
in your hair. Her jewelry box must look like a
junk drawer. Not that everything she wore was
stupid …
She had a pair of Vans he liked, with strawberries
on them. And she had a green sharkskin
blazer that Park would wear himself if he thought
he could get away with it.
Did she think she was getting away with it?
Park braced himself every morning before
she got on the bus, but you couldn’t brace yourself
enough for the sight of her.
‘Do you know her?’ Cal asked.
55/593
‘No,’ Park said quickly. ‘She’s on my bus.
She’s weird.’
‘Jungle fever is a thing,’ Cal said.
‘For black people. If you like black people.
And it’s not a compliment, I don’t think.’
‘Your people come from the jungle,’ Cal
said, pointing at Park. ‘Apocalypse Now,
anyone?’
‘You should ask Kim out,’ Park said. ‘That’s
a really good idea.’
Eleanor
Eleanor wasn’t going to fight over an e.e. cummings
book like it was the last Cabbage Patch
Kid. She found an empty table in the African
American literature section.
That was another fucked-up thing about this
school – effed-up, she corrected herself.
Most of the kids here were black, but most of
the kids in her honors classes were white. They
got bussed in from west Omaha. And the white
56/593
kids from the Flats, dishonor students, got bussed
in from the other direction.
Eleanor wished she had more honors classes.
She wished there was honors gym …
Like they’d ever let her into honors gym.
Eleanor would get put in remedial gym first.
With all the other fat girls who couldn’t do situps.
Anyway. Honor students – black, white or
Asia Minor – tended to be nicer. Maybe they
were just as mean on the inside, but they were
scared of getting in trouble. Or maybe they were
just as mean on the inside, but they’d been
trained to be polite – to give up their seats for old
people and girls.
Eleanor had honors English, history and geography,
but she spent the rest of her day in
Crazytown. Seriously, Blackboard Jungle. She
should probably try harder in her smart classes so
that she wouldn’t get kicked out of them.
She started copying a poem called ‘Caged
Bird’ into her notebook … Sweet. It rhymed.
57/593
CHAPTER 8
Park
She was reading his comics.
At first Park thought he was imagining it. He
kept getting this feeling that she was looking at
him, but whenever he looked over at her, her face
was down.
He finally realized that she was staring at his
lap. Not in a gross way. She was looking at his
comics – he could see her eyes moving.
Park didn’t know that anyone with red hair
could have brown eyes. (He didn’t know that
anyone could have hair that red. Or skin that
white.) The new girl’s eyes were darker than his
mom’s, really dark, almost like holes in her face.
That made it sound bad, but it wasn’t. It
might even be the best thing about her. It kind of
reminded Park of the way artists draw Jean Grey
sometimes when she’s using her telepathy, with
her eyes all blacked out and alien.
Today the girl was wearing a giant men’s
shirt with seashells all over it. The collar must
have been really big, like disco-big, because
she’d cut it, and it was fraying. She had a man’s
necktie wrapped around her ponytail like a big
polyester ribbon. She looked ridiculous.
And she was looking at his comics.
Park felt like he should say something to her.
He always felt like he should say something to
her, even if it was just ‘hello’ or ‘excuse me.’ But
he’d gone too long without saying anything since
the first time he’d cursed at her, and now it was
all just irrevocably weird. For an hour a day.
Thirty minutes on the way to school, thirty
minutes back.
Park didn’t say anything. He just held his
comics open wider and turned the pages more
slowly.
59/593
Eleanor
Her mom looked tired when Eleanor got home.
Like more tired than usual. Hard and crumbling
at the edges.
When the little kids stormed in after school,
her mom lost her temper over something stupid –
Ben and Mouse fighting over a toy – and she
pushed them all out the back door, Eleanor
included.
Eleanor was so startled to be outside that she
stood on the back stoop for a second, staring
down at Richie’s Rottweiler. He’d named the dog
Tonya after his ex-wife. She was supposed to be
a real man-eater, Tonya – Tonya the dog – but
Eleanor had never seen her more than half
awake.
Eleanor tried knocking on the door. ‘Mom!
Let me back in. I haven’t even taken a bath yet.’
She usually took her bath right after school,
before Richie got home. It took a lot of the stress
out of not having a bathroom door, especially
since somebody’d torn down the sheet.
60/593
Her mom ignored her.
The little kids were already out on the playground.
The new house was right next door to an
elementary school – the school where Ben and
Mouse and Maisie went – and the playground
was just beyond their backyard.
Eleanor didn’t know what else to do, so she
walked out to where she could see Ben, by the
swing set, and sat on one of the swings. It was finally
jacket weather. Eleanor wished she had a
jacket.
‘What are you supposed to do when it gets
too cold to play outside?’ she asked Ben. He was
taking Matchbox cars out of his pockets and lining
them up in the dirt. ‘Last year,’ he said, ‘Dad
made us go to bed at 7:30.’
‘God. You too? Why do you guys call him
that?’ She tried not to sound angry.
Ben shrugged. ‘I guess because he’s married
to Mom.’
‘Yeah, but’ – Eleanor ran her hands up and
down the swing chains, then smelled them – ‘we
61/593
never used to call him that. Do you feel like he’s
your dad?’
‘I don’t know,’ Ben said flatly. ‘What’s that
supposed to feel like?’
She didn’t answer him, so he went back to
setting up his cars. He needed a haircut, his
strawberry-blond hair was curling almost to his
collar. He was wearing an old T-shirt of Eleanor’s
and a pair of corduroy pants that their mom
had cut off into shorts. He was almost too old for
all this, for cars and parks – eleven. The other
boys his age played basketball all night or hung
out in groups at the edge of the playground.
Eleanor hoped that Ben was a late bloomer.
There was no room in that house to be a teenager.
‘He likes it when we call him Dad,’ Ben said,
still lining up the cars.
Eleanor looked out at the playground. Mouse
was playing with a bunch of kids who had a soccer
ball. Maisie must have taken the baby somewhere
with her friends …
62/593
It used to be Eleanor who was stuck with the
baby all the time. She wouldn’t even mind
watching him now, it would give her something
to do – but Maisie didn’t want Eleanor’s help.
‘What was it like?’ Ben asked.
‘What was what like?’
‘Living with those people.’
The sun was a few inches above the horizon,
and Eleanor looked hard at it.
‘Okay,’ she said. Terrible. Lonely. Better
than here.
‘Were there other kids?’
‘Yeah. Really little kids. Three of them.’
‘Did you have your own room?’
‘Sort of.’ Technically, she hadn’t had to share
the Hickmans’ living room with anyone else.
‘Were they nice?’ he asked.
‘Yeah … yeah. They were nice. Not as nice
as you.’
The Hickmans had started out nice. But then
they got tired.
63/593
Eleanor was only supposed to stay with them
for a few days, maybe a week. Just until Richie
cooled down and let her come home.
‘It’ll be like a slumber party,’ Mrs Hickman
said to Eleanor the first night she made up the
couch. Mrs Hickman – Tammy – knew Eleanor’s
mom from high school. There was a photo over
the TV of the Hickmans’ wedding. Eleanor’s
mom was the maid of honor – in a dark green
dress, with a white flower in her hair.
At first, her mom would call Eleanor at the
Hickmans’ almost every day after school. After a
few months, the calls stopped. It turned out that
Richie hadn’t paid the phone bill, and it got disconnected.
But Eleanor didn’t know that for a
while.
‘We should call the state,’ Mr Hickman kept
telling his wife. They thought Eleanor couldn’t
hear them, but their bedroom was right over the
living room. ‘This can’t go on, Tammy.’
‘Andy, it’s not her fault.’
64/593
‘I’m not saying it’s her fault, I’m just saying
we didn’t sign on for this.’
‘She’s no trouble.’
‘She’s not ours.’
Eleanor tried to be even less trouble. She
practiced being in a room without leaving any
clues that she’d been there. She never turned on
the TV or asked to use the phone. She never
asked for seconds at dinner. She never asked
Tammy and Mr Hickman for anything – and
they’d never had a teenager, so it didn’t occur to
them that there might be anything she might
need. She was glad that they didn’t know her
birthday.
‘We thought you were gone,’ Ben said, pushing
a car into the dirt. He looked like somebody
who didn’t want to cry.
‘Oh ye of little faith,’ Eleanor said, kicking
her swing into action.
She looked around again for Maisie and
found her sitting over where the older boys were
playing basketball. Eleanor recognized most of
65/593
the boys from the bus. That stupid Asian kid was
there, jumping higher than she would have
guessed he could. He was wearing long black
shorts and a T-shirt that said ‘Madness.’
‘I’m out of here,’ Eleanor told Ben, stepping
off the swing and pushing down the top of his
head. ‘But not gone or anything. Don’t get your
panties in a bunch.’
She walked back into the house and rushed
through the kitchen before her mom could say
anything. Richie was in the living room. Eleanor
walked between him and the TV, eyes straight
ahead. She wished she had a jacket.
66/593
CHAPTER 9
Park
He was going to tell her that she did a good job
on her poem.
That would be a giant understatement anyway.
She was the only person in class who’d read
her poem like it wasn’t an assignment. She recited
it like it was a living thing. Like something
she was letting out. You couldn’t look away from
her as long as she was talking. (Even more than
Park’s usual not being able to look away from
her.) When she was done, a lot of people clapped
and Mr Stessman hugged her. Which was totally
against the Code of Conduct.
‘Hey. Nice job. In English.’ That’s what Park
was going to say.
Or maybe, ‘I’m in your English class. That
poem you read was cool.’
Or, ‘You’re in Mr Stessman’s class, right?
Yeah, I thought so.’
Park picked up his comics after taekwando
Wednesday night, but he waited until Thursday
morning to read them.
Eleanor
That stupid Asian kid totally knew that she was
reading his comics. He even looked up at Eleanor
sometimes before he turned the page, like he was
that polite.
He definitely wasn’t one of them, the bus
demons. He didn’t talk to anyone on the bus.
(Especially not her.) But he was in with them
somehow because, when Eleanor was sitting next
to him, they all left her alone. Even Tina. It made
Eleanor wish she could sit next to him all day
long.
68/593
This morning, when she got on the bus, it
kind of felt like he was waiting for her. He was
holding a comic called Watchmen, and it looked
so ugly that Eleanor decided not to bother eavesdropping.
Or eavesreading. Whatever.
(She liked it best when he read X-Men, even
though she didn’t get everything that was going
on there; X-Men was worse than General Hospital.
It took Eleanor a couple weeks to figure out
that Scott Summers and Cyclops were the same
guy, and she still wasn’t sure what was up with
Phoenix.)
But Eleanor didn’t have anything else to do,
so her eyes wandered over to the ugly comic …
And then she was reading. And then they were at
school. Which was totally weird because they
weren’t even halfway through with it.
And which totally sucked because it meant he
would read the rest of the comic during school,
and have something lame like ROM out on the
way home.
Except he didn’t.
69/593
When Eleanor got on the bus that afternoon,
the Asian kid opened up Watchmen right where
they’d left off.
They were still reading it when they got to
Eleanor’s stop – there was so much going on,
they both stared at every frame for, like, entire
minutes – and when she got up to leave, he
handed it to her.
Eleanor was so surprised, she tried to hand it
back, but he’d already turned away. She shoved
the comic between her books like it was
something secret, then got off the bus.
She read it three more times that night, lying
on the top bunk, petting the scrubby old cat. Then
she put it in her grapefruit box overnight, so that
nothing would happen to it.
Park
What if she didn’t give it back?
What if he didn’t get to finish the first issue
of Watchmen because he’d lent it to a girl who
70/593
hadn’t asked for it and probably didn’t even
know who Alan Moore was.
If she didn’t give it back, they were even.
That would cancel out the whole ‘Jesus-fuck-sitdown’
scenario.
Jesus … No, it wouldn’t.
What if she did give it back? What was he
supposed to say then? Thanks?
Eleanor
When she got to their seat, he was looking out
the window. She handed him the comic, and he
took it.
71/593
CHAPTER 10
Eleanor
The next morning, when Eleanor got on the bus,
there was a stack of comics on her seat.
She picked them up and sat down. He was
already reading.
Eleanor put the comics between her books
and stared at the window. For some reason, she
didn’t want to read in front of him. It would be
like letting him watch her eat. It would be like …
admitting something.
But she thought about the comics all day, and
as soon she got home, she climbed onto her bed
and got them out. They were all the same title –
Swamp Thing.
Eleanor ate dinner sitting cross-legged on her
bed, extra careful not to spill anything on the
books because every issue was in pristine condition;
there wasn’t so much as a bent corner. (Stupid,
perfect Asian kid.)
That night, after her brothers and sister fell
asleep, Eleanor turned the light back on so she
could read. They were the loudest sleepers ever.
Ben talked in his sleep, and Maisie and the baby
both snored. Mouse wet the bed – which didn’t
make noise, but still disturbed the general peace.
The light didn’t seem to bother them though.
Eleanor was only distantly conscious of Richie
watching TV in the next room, and she practically
fell off the bed when he jerked the bedroom
door open. He looked like he expected to catch
some middle-of-the-night hijinks, but when he
saw that it was only Eleanor and that she was just
reading, he grunted and told her to turn out the
light so the little kids could sleep.
After he shut the door, Eleanor got up and
turned off the light. (She could just about get out
of bed without stepping on somebody now,
73/593
which was lucky for them because she was the
first one up every morning.)
She might have gotten away with leaving the
light on, but it wasn’t worth the risk. She didn’t
want to have to look at Richie again.
He looked exactly like a rat. Like the humanbeing
version of a rat. Like the villain in a Don
Bluth movie. Who knew what her mom saw in
him; Eleanor’s dad was messed-up-looking, too.
Every once in a while – when Richie managed
to take a bath, put on decent clothes and
stay sober all on the same day – Eleanor could
sort of see why her mom might have thought he
was handsome. Thank the Lord that didn’t happen
very often. When it did, Eleanor felt like going
to the bathroom and sticking a finger down
her throat.
Anyway. Whatever. She could still read.
There was enough light coming in from the
window.
Park
74/593
She read stuff as fast as he could give it to her.
And when she handed it back to him the next
morning, she always acted as if she were handing
him something fragile. Something precious. You
wouldn’t even know that she touched the comics
except for the smell.
Every book Park lent her came back smelling
like perfume. Not like the perfume his mom
wore. (Imari.) And not like the new girl; she
smelled like vanilla.
But she made his comics smell like roses. A
whole field of them.
She’d read all of his Alan Moore in less than
three weeks. Now he was giving her X-Men comics
five at a time, and he could tell that she liked
them because she wrote the characters’ names on
her books, in between band names and song
lyrics.
They still didn’t talk on the bus, but it had become
a less confrontational silence. Almost
friendly. (But not quite.)
75/593
Park would have to talk to her today – to tell
her that he didn’t have anything to give her. He’d
overslept, then forgotten to grab the stack of
comics he’d set out for her the night before. He
hadn’t even had time to eat breakfast or brush his
teeth, which made him self-conscious, knowing
he was going to be sitting so close to her.
But when she got on the bus and handed him
yesterday’s comics, all Park did was shrug. She
looked away. They both looked down.
She was wearing that ugly necktie again.
Today it was tied around her wrist. Her arms and
wrists were scattered with freckles, layers of
them in different shades of gold and pink, even
on the back of her hands. Little-boy hands, his
mom would call them, with short-short nails and
ragged cuticles.
She stared down at the books in her lap.
Maybe she thought he was mad at her. He stared
at her books, too – covered in ink and Art
Nouveau doodles.
76/593
‘So,’ he said, before he knew what to say
next, ‘you like the Smiths?’ He was careful not to
blow his morning breath on her.
She looked up, surprised. Maybe confused.
He pointed at her book, where she’d written
‘How Soon Is Now?’ in tall green letters.
‘I don’t know,’ she said. ‘I’ve never heard
them.’
‘So you just want people to think you like the
Smiths?’ He couldn’t help but sound disdainful.
‘Yeah,’ she said, looking around the bus. ‘I’m
trying to impress the locals.’
He didn’t know if she could help but sound
like a smartass, but she sure wasn’t trying. The
air soured between them. Park shifted against the
wall. She looked across the aisle to stare out the
window.
When he got to English, he tried to catch her
eye, but she looked away. He felt like she was
trying so hard to ignore him that she wouldn’t
even participate in class.
77/593
Mr Stessman kept trying to draw her out –
she was his new favorite target whenever things
got sleepy in class. Today they were supposed to
be discussing Romeo and Juliet, but nobody
wanted to talk.
‘You don’t seem troubled by their deaths,
Miss Douglas.’
‘I’m sorry?’ she said. She narrowed her eyes
at him.
‘It doesn’t strike you as sad?’ Mr Stessman
asked. ‘Two young lovers lay dead. Never was a
story of more woe. Doesn’t that get to you?’
‘I guess not,’ she said.
‘Are you so cold? So cool?’ He was standing
over her desk, pretending to plead with her.
‘No …’ she said. ‘I just don’t think it’s a
tragedy.’
‘It’s the tragedy,’ Mr Stessman said.
She rolled her eyes. She was wearing two or
three necklaces, old fake pearls, like Park’s
grandmother wore to church, and she twisted
them while she talked.
78/593
‘But he’s so obviously making fun of them,’
she said.
‘Who is?’
‘Shakespeare.’
‘Do tell …’
She rolled her eyes again. She knew Mr
Stessman’s game by now.
‘Romeo and Juliet are just two rich kids
who’ve always gotten every little thing they
wanted. And now, they think they want each
other.’
‘They’re in love …’ Mr Stessman said,
clutching his heart.
‘They don’t even know each other,’ she said.
‘It was love at first sight.’
‘It was “Oh my God, he’s so cute” at first
sight. If Shakespeare wanted you to believe they
were in love, he wouldn’t tell you in almost the
very first scene that Romeo was hung up on Rosaline
… It’s Shakespeare making fun of love,’
she said.
‘Then why has it survived?’
79/593
‘I don’t know, because Shakespeare is a
really good writer?’
‘No!’ Mr Stessman said. ‘Someone else,
someone with a heart. Mr Sheridan, what beats in
your chest? Tell us, why has Romeo and Juliet
survived four hundred years?’
Park hated talking in class. Eleanor frowned
at him, then looked away. He felt himself blush.
‘Because …’ he said quietly, looking at his
desk, ‘because people want to remember what
it’s like to be young? And in love?’
Mr Stessman leaned back against the blackboard
and rubbed his beard.
‘Is that right?’ Park asked.
‘Oh, it’s definitely right,’ Mr Stessman said.
‘I don’t know if that’s why Romeo and Juliet has
become the most beloved play of all time. But,
yes, Mr Sheridan. Truer words never spoken.’
She didn’t acknowledge Park in history class,
but she never did.
When he got on the bus that afternoon, she
was already there. She got up to let him have his
80/593
place by the window, and then she surprised him
by talking. Quietly. Almost under her breath. But
talking.
‘It’s more like a wish list,’ she said.
‘What?’
‘They’re songs I’d like to hear. Or bands I’d
like to hear. Stuff that looks interesting.’
‘If you’ve never heard the Smiths, how do
you even know about them?’
‘I don’t know,’ she said defensively. ‘My
friends, my old friends … magazines. I don’t
know. Around.’
‘Why don’t you just listen to them?’
She looked at him like he was officially an
idiot. ‘It’s not like they play the Smiths on Sweet
98.’
And then, when Park didn’t say anything, she
rolled her inky brown eyes into the back of her
head. ‘God,’ she said.
They didn’t talk anymore all the way home.
That night, while he did his homework, Park
made a tape with all of his favorite Smiths songs,
81/593
plus a few songs by Echo and the Bunnymen, and
Joy Division.
He put the tape and five more X-Men comics
into his backpack before he went to bed.
82/593
CHAPTER 11
Eleanor
‘Why are you so quiet?’ Eleanor’s mother asked.
Eleanor was taking a bath, and her mom was
making fifteen-bean soup. ‘That leaves three
beans for each us,’ Ben had cracked to Eleanor
earlier.
‘I’m not quiet. I’m taking a bath.’
‘Usually you sing in the bathtub.’
‘I do not,’ Eleanor said.
‘You do. Usually you sing “Rocky
Raccoon.”’
‘God. Well, thanks for telling me, I won’t
anymore. God.’
Eleanor got dressed quickly and tried to
squeeze past her mother. Her mom grabbed her
by the wrists. ‘I like to hear you sing,’ she said.
She reached for a bottle on the counter behind
Eleanor and rubbed a drop of vanilla behind each
of the girl’s ears. Eleanor raised her shoulders
like it tickled.
‘Why do you always do that? I smell like a
Strawberry Shortcake doll.’
‘I do it,’ her mom said, ‘because it’s cheaper
than perfume, but it smells just as good.’ Then
she rubbed some vanilla behind her own ears and
laughed.
Eleanor laughed with her, and stood there for
a few seconds smiling. Her mom was wearing
soft old jeans and a T-shirt, and her hair was
pulled back in a smooth ponytail. She looked almost
like she used to. There was a picture of her
– at one of Maisie’s birthday parties, scooping
ice cream cones – with a ponytail just like that.
‘Are you okay?’ her mom asked.
‘Yeah …’ Eleanor said, ‘yeah, I’m just tired.
I’m going to do my homework and go to bed.’
Her mom seemed to know that something was
off, but she didn’t push. She used to make
84/593
Eleanor tell her everything. ‘What’s going on up
there?’ she’d say, knocking on the top of Eleanor’s
head. ‘Are you making yourself crazy?’ Her
mom hadn’t said anything like that since Eleanor
had moved home. She seemed to realize that
she’d lost her right to knock.
Eleanor climbed up onto her bunk and pushed
the cat to the end. She didn’t have anything to
read. Nothing new, anyway. Was he done bringing
her comics? Why had he even started? She
ran her fingers over the embarrassing song titles
– ‘This Charming Man’ and ‘How Soon Is
Now?’ – on her math book. She wanted to
scribble them out, but he’d probably notice and
lord it over her.
Eleanor really was tired, that wasn’t a lie.
She’d been staying up, reading, almost every
night. She fell asleep that night right after dinner.
She woke up to shouting. Richie shouting. Eleanor
couldn’t tell what he was saying.
Underneath the shouting, her mother was crying.
She sounded like she’d been crying for a
85/593
long time – she must be completely out of her
head if she was letting them hear her cry like
that.
Eleanor could tell that everyone else in the
room was already awake. She hung off the bunk
until she could see the little kids take shape in the
dark. All four of them were sitting together in a
clump of blankets on the floor. Maisie was holding
the baby, rocking him almost frantically.
Eleanor slid off the bed soundlessly and huddled
with them. Mouse immediately climbed into her
lap. He was shaking and wet, and he wrapped his
arms and legs around Eleanor like a monkey.
Their mother shrieked, two rooms away, and they
all five jumped together.
If this had happened two summers ago,
Eleanor would have run and banged on the door
herself. She would have yelled at Richie to stop.
She would have called 911 at the very, very, very
least. But now that seemed like something a child
would do, or a fool. Now, all she could think
about was what they were going to do if the baby
86/593
actually started to cry. Thank God he didn’t.
Even he seemed to realize that trying to make
this stop would only ever make it worse.
When her alarm went off the next morning,
Eleanor couldn’t remember having fallen to
sleep. She couldn’t remember when the crying
had stopped.
A horrible thought came to her, and she got
up, stumbling over the kids and the blankets. She
opened the bedroom door and smelled bacon.
Which meant that her mother was alive.
And that her stepdad was probably still eating
breakfast.
Eleanor took a deep breath. She smelled like
pee. God. The cleanest clothes she had were the
ones she wore yesterday, which Tina would
surely point out, because it was a goddamn gym
day on top of everything else.
She grabbed her clothes and stepped purposely
out into the living room, determined not to
make eye contact with Richie if he was there. He
was. (That demon. That bastard.) Her mother
87/593
was standing at the stove, standing more still than
usual. You couldn’t not notice the bruise on the
side of her face. Or the hickey under her chin.
(That fuck, that fuck, that fuck.)
‘Mom,’ Eleanor whispered urgently, ‘I have
to clean off.’ Her mother’s eyes slowly focused
on her.
‘What?’
Eleanor gestured at her clothes, which probably
just looked wrinkled. ‘I slept on the floor
with Mouse.’
Her mother glanced nervously into the living
room; Richie would punish Mouse if he knew.
‘Okay, okay,’ she said, pushing Eleanor into the
bathroom. ‘Give me your clothes, I’ll watch the
door. And don’t let him smell it. I don’t need this
this morning.’
As if Eleanor was the one who’d peed all
over everything.
She washed off the top half of her body, then
the bottom, so that she wouldn’t ever be totally
naked. Then she walked back through the living
88/593
room, wearing yesterday’s clothes, trying really
hard not to smell like pee.
Her books were in her bedroom, but Eleanor
didn’t want to open the door and let out any more
acrid air – so she just left.
She got to the bus stop fifteen minutes early.
She still felt rumpled and panicked, and, thanks
to the bacon, her stomach was growling.
89/593
CHAPTER 12
Park
When Park got on the bus, he set the comics and
Smiths tape on the seat next to him, so they’d just
be waiting for her. So he wouldn’t have to say
anything.
When she got on the bus a few minutes later,
Park could tell that something was wrong. She
got on like she was lost and ended up there. She
was wearing the same thing she’d worn yesterday
– which wasn’t that weird, she was always wearing
a different version of the same thing – but
today was different. Her neck and wrists were
bare, and her hair was a mess – a pile, an all-over
glob, of red curls.
She stopped at their seat and looked down at
the pile of stuff he’d left for her. (Where were her
schoolbooks? He wondered) Then she picked
everything up, careful as ever, and sat down.
Park wanted to look at her face, but he
couldn’t. He stared at her wrists instead. She
picked up the cassette. He’d written ‘How Soon
is Now and More’ on the thin white sticker.
She held it out to him.
‘Thank you …’ she said. Now that was
something he’d never heard her say before. ‘But I
can’t.’
He didn’t take it.
‘It’s for you, take it,’ he whispered. He
looked up from her hands to her dropped chin.
‘No,’ she said, ‘I mean, thank you, but … I
can’t.’ She tried to give him the tape, but he
didn’t take it. Why did she have to make every
little thing so hard?
‘I don’t want it,’ he said.
She clenched her teeth and glared. She really
must hate him.
‘No,’ she said, practically loud enough for
other people to hear. ‘I mean, I can’t. I don’t
91/593
have any way to listen to it. God, just take it
back.’
He took it. She covered her face. The kid in
the seat across from them, a twerpy senior who
was actually named Junior, was watching.
Park frowned at Junior until he turned away.
Then Park turned back to the girl …
He took his Walkman out of the pocket of his
trench coat and popped out his Dead Kennedys
tape. He slid the new tape in, pressed play, then –
carefully – put the headphones over her hair. He
was so careful, he didn’t even touch her.
He could hear the swampy guitar start and
then the first line of the song. ‘I am the son …
and the heir …’
She lifted her head a little but didn’t look at
him. She didn’t move her hands away from her
face.
When they got to school, she took the headphones
off and gave them back to him.
They got off the bus together and stayed together.
Which was weird. Usually, they broke
92/593
away from each other as soon as they hit the sidewalk.
That’s what seemed weird now, Park
thought; they walked the same way every day,
her locker was just down the hall from his – how
had they managed to go their separate ways every
morning?
Park stopped for a minute when they got to
her locker. He didn’t step close to her, but he
stopped. She stopped, too.
‘Well,’ he said, looking down the hall, ‘now
you’ve heard the Smiths.’
And she …
Eleanor laughed.
Eleanor
She should have just taken the tape.
She didn’t need to be telling everybody what
she had and didn’t have. She didn’t need to be
telling weird Asian kids anything.
Weird Asian kid.
93/593
She was pretty sure he was Asian. It was hard
to tell. He had green eyes. And skin the color of
sunshine through honey.
Maybe he was Filipino. Was that in Asia?
Probably. Asia’s out-of-control huge.
Eleanor had only known one Asian person in
her life – Paul, who was in her math class at her
old school. Paul was Chinese. His parents had
moved to Omaha to get away from the Chinese
government. (Which seemed like an extreme
choice. Like they’d looked at the globe and said,
‘Yup. That’s as far away as possible.’)
Paul was the one who’d taught Eleanor to say
‘Asian’ and not ‘oriental.’ ‘Oriental’s for food,’
he’d said.
‘Whatever, LaChoy Boy,’ she’d said back.
Eleanor couldn’t figure out what an Asian
person was doing in the Flats anyway. Everybody
else here was seriously white. Like, white by
choice. Eleanor had never even heard the n-word
said out loud until she moved here, but the kids
on her bus used it like it was the only way to
94/593
indicate that somebody was black. Like there was
no other word or phrase that would work.
Eleanor stayed away from the n-word even in
her head. It was bad enough that, thanks to Richie’s
influence, she went around mentally calling
everyone she met a ‘motherfucker.’ (Irony.)
There were three or four other Asian kids at
their school. Cousins. One of them had written an
essay about being a refugee from Laos.
And then there was Ol’ Green Eyes.
Who she was apparently going to tell her
whole life story to. Maybe on the way home,
she’d tell him that she didn’t have a phone or a
washing machine or a toothbrush.
That last thing, she was thinking about telling
her counselor. Mrs Dunne had sat Eleanor down
on her first day of school and given a little speech
about how Eleanor could tell her anything. All
through the speech, she kept squeezing the fattest
part of Eleanor’s arm.
95/593
If Eleanor told Mrs Dunne everything – about
Richie, her mom, everything – Eleanor didn’t
know what would happen.
But if she told Mrs Dunne about the toothbrush
… maybe Mrs Dunne would just get her
one. And then Eleanor could stop sneaking into
the bathroom after lunch to rub her teeth with
salt. (She’d seen that in a Western once. It probably
didn’t even work.)
The bell rang. 10:12.
Just two more periods until English. She
wondered if he’d talk to her in class. Maybe
that’s what they did now.
She could still hear that voice in her head –
not his – the singer’s. From the Smiths. You
could hear his accent, even when he was singing.
He sounded like he was crying out.
‘I am the sun …
And the air …’
Eleanor didn’t notice at first how un-horrible
everyone was being in gym. (Her head was still
on the bus.) They were playing volleyball today,
96/593
and once Tina said, ‘Your serve, bitch,’ but that
was it, and that was practically jocular, allthings-
Tina considered.
When Eleanor got to the locker room, she
realized why Tina had been so low-key; she was
just waiting. Tina and her friends – and the black
girls, too, everybody wanted a piece of this –
were standing at the end of Eleanor’s row, waiting
for her to walk to her locker.
It was covered with Kotex pads. A whole
box, it looked like.
At first Eleanor thought the pads were actually
bloody, but when she got closer she could
see that it was just red magic marker. Somebody
had written ‘Raghead’ and ‘Big Red’ on a few of
the pads, but they were the expensive kind, so the
ink was already starting to absorb.
If Eleanor’s clothes weren’t in that locker, if
she was wearing anything other than this gymsuit,
she would have just walked away.
Instead she walked past the girls, with her
chin as high as she could manage, and
97/593
methodically peeled the pads off her locker.
There were even some inside, stuck to her
clothes.
Eleanor cried a little bit, she couldn’t help it,
but she kept her back to everybody so there
wouldn’t be a show. It was all over in a few
minutes anyway because nobody wanted to be
late to lunch. Most of the girls still had to change
and redo their hair.
After everyone else walked away, two black
girls stayed. They walked over to Eleanor and
started pulling pads off the wall. ‘Ain’t no thing,’
one of the girls whispered, crumpling a pad into a
ball. Her name was DeNice, and she looked too
young to be in the tenth grade. She was small,
and she wore her hair in two braided pigtails.
Eleanor shook her head, but didn’t say
anything.
‘Those girls are trifling,’ DeNice said.
‘They’re so insignificant, God can hardly see
them.’
98/593
‘Hmm-hmm,’ the other girl agreed. Eleanor
was pretty sure her name was Beebi. Beebi was
what Eleanor’s mom would call ‘a big girl.’
Much bigger than Eleanor. Beebi’s gymsuit was
even a different color than everybody else’s, like
they’d had to special order it for her. Which
made Eleanor feel bad about feeling so bad about
her own body … And which also made her wonder
why she was the official fat girl in the class.
They threw the pads in the trash and pushed
them under some wet paper towels so that
nobody would find them.
If DeNice and Beebi hadn’t been standing
there, Eleanor might have kept some of the pads,
the ones that didn’t have any writing on them because,
God, what a waste.
She was late to lunch, then late to English.
And if she didn’t know already that she liked that
stupid effing Asian kid, she knew it now.
Because even after everything that had
happened in the last forty-five minutes – and
everything that had happened in the last twenty-
99/593
four hours – all Eleanor could think about was
seeing Park.
Park
When they got back on the bus, she took his
Walkman without arguing. And without making
him put it on for her. At the stop before hers, she
handed it back.
‘You can borrow it,’ he said quietly. ‘Listen
to the rest of the tape.’
‘I don’t want to break it,’ she said.
‘You’re not going to break it.’
‘I don’t want to use up the batteries.’
‘I don’t care about the batteries.’
She looked up at him then, in the eye, maybe
for the first time ever. Her hair looked even crazier
than it had this morning – more frizzy than
curly, like she was working on a big red afro. But
her eyes were dead serious, cold sober. Any
cliché you’ve ever heard used to describe Clint
Eastwood, those were Eleanor’s eyes.
100/593
‘Really,’ she said. ‘You don’t care.’
‘They’re just batteries,’ he said.
She emptied the batteries and the tape from
Park’s Walkman, handed it back to him, then got
off the bus without looking back.
God, she was weird.
Eleanor
The batteries started to die at 1:00 a.m., but
Eleanor kept listening for another hour until the
voices slowed to a stop.
101/593
CHAPTER 13
Eleanor
She remembered her books today, and she was
wearing fresh clothes. She’d had to wash her
jeans out in the bathtub last night, so they were
still kind of damp … But altogether, Eleanor felt
a thousand times better than she had yesterday.
Even her hair was halfway cooperating. She’d
clumped it up into a bun and wrapped it with a
rubber band. It was going to hurt like crazy trying
to tear the rubber band out, but at least it was
staying for now.
Best of all, she had Park’s songs in her head –
and in her chest, somehow.
There was something about the music on that
tape. It felt different. Like, it set her lungs and
her stomach on edge. There was something
exciting about it, and something nervous. It made
Eleanor feel like everything, like the world,
wasn’t what she’d thought it was. And that was a
good thing. That was the greatest thing.
When she got on the bus that morning, she
immediately lifted her head to find Park. He was
looking up too, like he was waiting for her. She
couldn’t help it, she grinned. Just for a second.
As soon as she sat down, Eleanor slunk low
in the seat, so the back-of-the-bus ruffians
wouldn’t be able to see from the top of her head
how happy she felt.
She could feel Park sitting next to her, even
though he was at least six inches away.
She handed him yesterday’s comics, then
tugged nervously at the green ribbon wound
round her wrist. She couldn’t think of what to
say. She started to worry that maybe she
wouldn’t say anything, that she wouldn’t even
thank him …
Park’s hands were perfectly still in his lap.
And perfectly perfect. Honey-colored with clean,
103/593
pink fingernails. Everything about him was
strong and slender. Every time he moved he had
a reason.
They were almost to school when he broke
the silence.
‘Did you listen?’
She nodded, letting her eyes climb as high as
his shoulders.
‘Did you like it?’ he asked.
She rolled her eyes. ‘Oh my God. It was …
just, like …’ – she spread out all her fingers – ‘so
awesome.’
‘Are you being sarcastic? I can’t tell.’
She looked up at his face, even though she
knew how that was going to feel, like someone
was hooking her insides out through her chest.
‘No. It was awesome. I didn’t want to stop
listening. That one song – is it “Love Will Tear
Us Apart”?’
‘Yeah, Joy Division.’
‘Oh my God, that’s the best beginning to a
song ever.’
104/593
He imitated the guitar and the drums.
‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,’ she said. ‘I just wanted to
listen to those three seconds over and over.’
‘You could have.’ His eyes were smiling, his
mouth only sort of.
‘I didn’t want to waste the batteries,’ she said.
He shook his head, like she was dumb.
‘Plus,’ she said, ‘I love the rest of it just as
much, like the high part, the melody, the dahhh,
dah-de-dah-dah, de-dahh, de dahhh.’
He nodded.
‘And his voice at the end,’ she said, ‘when he
goes just a little bit too high … And then the very
end, where it sounds like the drums are fighting
it, like they don’t want the song to be over …’
Park made drum noises with his mouth: ‘chch-
ch, ch-ch-ch.’
‘I just want to break that song into pieces,’
she said, ‘and love them all to death.’
That made him laugh.
‘What about the Smiths?’ he asked.
‘I didn’t know who was who,’ she said.
105/593
‘I’ll write it down for you.’
‘I liked it all.’
‘Good,’ he said.
‘I loved it.’
He smiled, but turned away to look out the
window. She looked down.
They were pulling into the parking lot. Eleanor
didn’t want this new talking thing – like, really
talking, back and forth and smiling at each other
– to stop.
‘And …’ she said quickly, ‘I love the X-Men.
But I hate Cyclops.’
He whipped his head back.
‘You can’t hate Cyclops. He’s team captain.’
‘He’s boring. He’s worse than Batman.’
‘What? You hate Batman?’
‘God. So boring. I can’t even make myself
read it. Whenever you bring Batman, I catch myself
listening to Steve, or staring out the window,
wishing I was in hypersleep.’ The bus came to a
stop.
106/593
‘Huh,’ Park said, standing up. He said it
really judgmentally.
‘What?’
‘Now I know what you’re thinking when you
stare out the window.’
‘No, you don’t,’ she said. ‘I mix it up.’
Everybody else was pushing down the aisle
past them. Eleanor stood up, too.
‘I’m bringing you The Dark Knight Returns,’
he said.
‘What’s that?’
‘Only the least boring Batman story ever.’
‘The least boring Batman story ever, huh?
Does Batman raise both eyebrows?’
He laughed again. His face completely
changed when he laughed. He didn’t have
dimples, exactly, but the sides of his face folded
in on themselves, and his eyes almost
disappeared.
‘Just wait,’ he said.
Park
107/593
That morning, in English, Park noticed that
Eleanor’s hair came to a soft red point on the
back of her neck.
Eleanor
That afternoon, in history, Eleanor noticed that
Park chewed on his pencil when he was thinking.
And that the girl sitting behind him – what’s her
name, Kim, with the giant breasts and the orange
Esprit bag – obviously had a crush on him.
Park
That night, Park made a tape with the Joy Division
song on it, over and over again.
He emptied all his handheld video games and
Josh’s remote-control cars, and called his
grandma to tell her that all he wanted for his
birthday in November was double-A batteries.
108/593
CHAPTER 14
Eleanor
‘I know she doesn’t think I’m going to jump over
that thing,’ DeNice said.
DeNice and the other girl, the big girl, Beebi,
talked to Eleanor now in gym. (Because being assaulted
with maxi pads is a great way to win
friends and influence people.)
Today in class, their gym teacher, Mrs Burt,
had shown them how to swing over a thousandyear-
old gymnastics horse. She said that next
time everybody had to try.
‘She has got another thing coming,’ DeNice
said after class, in the locker room. ‘Do I look
like Mary Lou Retton?’
Beebi giggled. ‘Better tell her you didn’t eat
your Wheaties.’
Actually, Eleanor thought, DeNice did kind
of look like a gymnast. With her little-girl bangs
and braids. She looked way too young to be in
high school, and her clothes just made it worse.
Puffed-sleeve shirts, overalls, matching ponytail
balls … She wore her gymsuit baggy, like a
romper.
Eleanor wasn’t scared of the horse, but she
didn’t want to have to run down the mats with the
whole class watching her. She didn’t want to run,
period. It made her breasts feel like they were going
to detach from her body.
‘I’m going to tell Mrs Burt that my mom
doesn’t want me to do anything that might rupture
my hymen,’ Eleanor said. ‘For religious
reasons.’
‘For real?’ Beebi asked.
‘No,’ Eleanor said, giggling. ‘Well. Actually
…’
‘You’re nasty,’ DeNice said, hitching up her
overalls.
110/593
Eleanor put her T-shirt on over her head then
wriggled out of her gymsuit, using the shirt as
cover.
‘Are you coming?’ DeNice asked.
‘Well, I’m probably not going to start skipping
class now just because of gymnastics,’
Eleanor said, hopping to pull up her jeans.
‘No, are you coming to lunch?’
‘Oh,’ Eleanor said, looking up. They were
waiting for her at the end of the lockers. ‘Yeah.’
‘Then hurry up, Miss Jackson.’
She sat with DeNice and Beebi at their usual
table by the windows. During passing period,
Eleanor saw Park walk by.
Park
‘Why can’t you get your driver’s license by
homecoming?’ Cal asked.
Mr Stessman had them in small groups. They
were supposed to be comparing Juliet to Ophelia.
111/593
‘Because I can’t bend time and space,’ Park
said. Eleanor was sitting across the room by the
windows. She was paired up with a guy named
Eric, a basketball player. He was talking, and
Eleanor was frowning at him.
‘If you had your car,’ Cal said, ‘we could ask
Kim.’
‘You can ask Kim,’ Park said.
Eric was one of those tall guys who always
walked with his shoulders about a foot behind his
hips. Constantly doing the limbo. Like he was
afraid to hit his head on every door jamb.
‘She wants to go with a group,’ Cal said.
‘Plus I think she likes you.’
‘What? I don’t want to go to homecoming
with Kim. I don’t even like her. I mean, you
know … You like her.’
‘I know. That’s why the plan works. We all
go to homecoming together. She figures out you
don’t like her, she’s miserable, and guess who’s
standing right there, asking her to slow dance?’
‘I don’t want to make Kim miserable.’
112/593
‘It’s her or me, man.’
Eric said something else, and Eleanor
frowned again. Then she looked over at Park –
and stopped frowning. Park smiled.
‘One minute,’ Mr Stessman said.
‘Crap,’ Cal said. ‘What have we got …
Ophelia was bonkers, right? And Juliet was what,
a sixth-grader?’
Eleanor
‘So Psylocke is another girl telepath?’
‘Uh-huh,’ Park said.
Every morning when Eleanor got on the bus,
she worried that Park wouldn’t take off his headphones.
That he would stop talking to her as suddenly
as he’d started … And if that happened – if
she got on the bus one day and he didn’t look up
– she didn’t want him to see how devastated it
would make her.
So far, it hadn’t happened.
113/593
So far, they hadn’t stopped talking. Like, literally.
They talked every second they were sitting
next to each other. And almost every conversation
started with the words ‘what do you think
…’
What did Eleanor think about that U2 album?
She loved it.
What did Park think of Miami Vice? He
thought it was boring.
‘Yes,’ they said when they agreed with each
other. Back and forth – ‘Yes,’ ‘Yes,’ ‘Yes!’
‘I know.’
‘Exactly.’
‘Right?’
They agreed about everything important and
argued about everything else. And that was good,
too, because whenever they argued, Eleanor
could always crack Park up.
‘Why do the X-Men need another girl telepath?’
she asked.
‘This one has purple hair.’
‘It’s all so sexist.’
114/593
Park’s eyes got wide. Well, sort of wide. Sometimes
she wondered if the shape of his eyes affected
how he saw things. That was probably the
most racist question of all time.
‘The X-Men aren’t sexist,’ he said, shaking
his head. ‘They’re a metaphor for acceptance;
they’ve sworn to protect a world that hates and
fears them.’
‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘but …’
‘There’s no but,’ he said, laughing.
‘But,’ Eleanor insisted, ‘the girls are all so
stereotypically girly and passive. Half of them
just think really hard. Like that’s their superpower,
thinking. And Shadowcat’s power is even
worse – she disappears.’
‘She becomes intangible,’ Park said. ‘That’s
different.’
‘It’s still something you could do in the
middle of a tea party,’ Eleanor said.
‘Not if you were holding hot tea. Plus, you’re
forgetting Storm.’
115/593
‘I’m not forgetting Storm. She controls the
weather with her head; it’s still just thinking.
Which is about all she could do in those boots.’
‘She has a cool Mohawk …’ Park said.
‘Irrelevant,’ Eleanor answered.
Park leaned his head back against the seat,
smiling, and looked at the ceiling. ‘The X-Men
aren’t sexist.’
‘Are you trying to think of an empowered Xwoman?’
Eleanor asked. ‘How about Dazzler?
She’s a living disco ball. Or the White Queen?
She thinks really hard while wearing spotless
white lingerie.’
‘What kind of power would you want?’ he
asked, changing the subject. He turned his face
toward her, laying his cheek against the top of the
seat. Smiling.
‘I’d want to fly,’ Eleanor said, looking away
from him. ‘I know it’s not very useful, but … it’s
flying.’
‘Yes,’ he said.
116/593
Park
‘Damn, Park, are you going on a Ninja mission?’
‘Ninjas wear black, Steve.’
‘What?’
Park should have gone inside to change after
taekwando, but his dad said he had to be back by
9:00, and that gave him less than an hour to show
Eleanor.
Steve was outside working on his Camaro.
He didn’t have his license yet either, but he was
getting ready.
‘Going to see your girlfriend?’ he called to
Park.
‘What?’
‘Sneaking out to see your girlfriend? Bloody
Mary?’
‘She’s not my girlfriend,’ Park said, then
swallowed.
‘Sneaking out Ninja-style,’ Steve said.
Park shook his head and broke into a run.
Well, she wasn’t, he thought to himself, cutting
through the alley.
117/593
He didn’t know where Eleanor lived, exactly.
He knew where she got on the bus, and he knew
that she lived next to the school …
It must be this one, he thought. He stopped at
a small white house. There were a few broken
toys in the yard, and a giant Rottweiler was
asleep on the porch.
Park walked toward the house slowly. The
dog lifted its head and watched him for a second,
then settled back to sleep. It didn’t move, even
when Park climbed the steps and knocked on the
door.
The guy who answered looked too young to
be Eleanor’s dad. Park was pretty sure he’d seen
this guy around the neighborhood. He didn’t
know who he’d expected to come to the door.
Somebody more exotic. Somebody more like her.
The guy didn’t even say anything. Just stood
at the door and waited.
‘Is Eleanor home?’ Park asked.
‘Who wants to know?’ He had a nose like a
knife, and he looked straight down it at Park.
118/593
‘We go to school together,’ Park said.
The guy looked at Park for another second,
then closed the door. Park wasn’t sure what to
do. He waited for a few minutes, then right as he
was thinking about leaving, Eleanor opened the
door just enough to slide through.
Her eyes were round with alarm. In the dark
like this, it didn’t even look like she had irises.
As soon as he saw her, he knew it had been a
mistake to come here – he felt like he should
have known that sooner. He’d been so caught up
in showing her …
‘Hey,’ he said.
‘Hi.’
‘I …’
‘… came to challenge me in hand-to-hand
combat?’
Park reached into the front of his dobak and
pulled out the second issue of Watchmen. Her
face lit up; she was so pale, so luminous under
the street light, that wasn’t just an expression.
‘Have you read it?’ she asked.
119/593
He shook his head. ‘I thought we could …
together.’
Eleanor glanced back at the house, then
stepped quickly off the steps. He followed her
down the steps, across the gravel driveway, to the
back stoop of the elementary school. There was a
big safety light over the door. Eleanor sat on the
top step, and Park sat next to her.
It took twice as long to read Watchmen as it
did any other comic, and it took even longer tonight
because it was so strange to be sitting together
somewhere other than on the bus. To even
see each other outside of school. Eleanor’s hair
was wet and hanging in long, dark curls around
her face.
When they got to the last page, all Park
wanted to do was sit and talk about it. (All he
really wanted to do was sit and talk to Eleanor.)
But she was already standing up and looking
back at her house.
‘I’ve got to go,’ she said.
‘Oh,’ he said. ‘Okay. I guess I do, too.’
120/593
She left him sitting on the elementary school
steps. She was disappearing inside the house before
he could think about saying goodbye.
Eleanor
When she walked back into the house, the living
room was dark, but the TV was on. Eleanor could
see Richie sitting on the couch and her mom
standing in the doorway of the kitchen.
It was just a few steps to her room …
‘Is that your boyfriend?’ Richie asked before
she made it. He didn’t look up from the TV.
‘No,’ she said. ‘He’s just a boy from school.’
‘What did he want?’
‘To talk to me about an assignment.’
She waited in her bedroom doorway. Then,
when Richie didn’t say anything more, she
stepped inside, shutting the door behind her.
‘I know what you’re up to,’ he said, raising
his voice, just as the door closed. ‘Nothing but a
bitch in heat.’
121/593
Eleanor let his words hit her full on. Took
them right on the chin.
She climbed into bed and clenched her eyes
and jaw and fists – held everything clenched until
she could breathe without screaming.
Until this moment, she’d kept Park in a place
in her head that she thought Richie couldn’t get
to. Completely separate from this house and
everything that happened here. (It was a pretty
awesome place. Like the only part of her head fit
for praying.)
But now Richie was in there, just pissing all
over everything. Making everything she felt feel
as rank and rotten as him.
Now she couldn’t think about Park …
About the way he looked in the dark, dressed
in white, like a superhero.
About the way he smelled, like sweat and bar
soap.
About the way he smiled when he liked
something, with his lips just turned up at the
corners …
122/593
Without feeling Richie leer.
She kicked the cat out of the bed, just to be
mean. He squawked, but jumped right back up.
‘Eleanor,’ Maisie whispered from the bottom
bunk, ‘was that your boyfriend?’
Eleanor crushed her teeth together. ‘No,’ she
whispered back viciously. ‘He’s just a boy.’
123/593
CHAPTER 15
Eleanor
Her mother stood in the bedroom the next morning
while Eleanor got ready. ‘Here,’ she
whispered, taking the hairbrush and drawing
Eleanor’s hair into a ponytail without brushing
out the curl.
‘Eleanor …’ she said.
‘I know why you’re in here,’ Eleanor said,
pulling away. ‘I don’t want to talk about it.’
‘Just listen.’
‘No. I know. He won’t come back, okay? I
didn’t invite him, but I’ll tell him, and he won’t
come back.’
‘Okay, well … good,’ her mom said, folding
her arms, still whispering. ‘It’s just that you’re so
young.’
‘No,’ Eleanor said, ‘that’s not what it is. But
it doesn’t even matter. He won’t come back,
okay? It isn’t even like that anyway.’
Her mom left the room. Richie was still in the
house. Eleanor ran out the front door when she
heard him turn on the bathroom sink.
It’s not even like that, she thought as she
walked to the bus stop. And thinking it made her
want to cry, because she knew it was true.
And wanting to cry just made her angry.
Because if she was going to cry about
something, it was going to be the fact that her life
was complete shit – not because some cool, cute
guy didn’t like her like that.
Especially when just being Park’s friend was
pretty much the best thing that had ever happened
to her.
She must have looked ticked off when she got
on the bus because Park didn’t say hi when she
sat down.
Eleanor looked into the aisle.
125/593
After a few seconds, he reached over and
pulled at the old silk scarf she’d tied around her
wrist.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said.
‘For what?’ She even sounded angry. God,
she was a jerk.
‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘I feel like maybe I
got you in trouble last night …’
He pulled on the scarf again, so she looked at
him. She tried not to look mad – but she’d rather
look mad than look like she’d spent all night
thinking about how beautiful his lips are.
‘Was that your dad?’ he asked.
She jerked her head back. ‘No. No, that was
my … mother’s husband. He’s not really my anything.
My problem, I guess.’
‘Did you get in trouble?’
‘Sort of.’ She really didn’t want to talk to
Park about Richie. She’d just about scraped all
the Richie off the Park place in her head.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said again.
126/593
‘It’s okay,’ she said. ‘It wasn’t your fault.
Anyway, thanks for bringing Watchmen. I’m glad
I got to read it.’
‘It was cool, huh?’
‘Oh, yeah. Kind of brutal. I mean that part
with the Comedian …’
‘Yeah … sorry.’
‘No, I didn’t mean that. I mean … I think I
need to reread it.’
‘I read it again twice last night. You can take
it tonight.’
‘Yeah? Thanks.’
He was still holding the end of her scarf, rubbing
the silk idly between his thumb and fingers.
She watched his hand.
If he were to look up at her now, he’d know
exactly how stupid she was. She could feel her
face go soft and gummy. If Park were to look up
at her now, he’d know everything.
He didn’t look up. He wound the scarf around
his fingers until her hand was hanging in the
space between them.
127/593
Then he slid the silk and his fingers into her
open palm.
And Eleanor disintegrated.
Park
Holding Eleanor’s hand was like holding a butterfly.
Or a heartbeat. Like holding something
complete, and completely alive.
As soon as he touched her, he wondered how
he’d gone this long without doing it. He rubbed
his thumb through her palm and up her fingers,
and was aware of her every breath.
Park had held hands with girls before. Girls at
Skateland. A girl at the ninth-grade dance last
year. (They’d kissed while they waited for her
dad to pick them up.) He’d even held Tina’s
hand, back when they ‘went’ together in the sixth
grade.
And always, before, it had been fine. Not
much different from holding Josh’s hand when
they were little kids crossing the street. Or
128/593
holding his grandma’s hand when she took him
to church. Maybe a little sweatier, a little more
awkward.
When he’d kissed that girl last year, with his
mouth dry and his eyes mostly open, Park had
wondered if maybe there was something wrong
with him.
He’d even wondered – seriously, while he
was kissing her, he’d wondered this – whether he
might be gay. Except he didn’t feel like kissing
any guys either. And if he thought about She-
Hulk or Storm (instead of this girl, Dawn) the
kissing got a lot better.
Maybe I’m not attracted to real girls, he’d
thought at the time. Maybe I’m some sort of
perverted cartoon-sexual.
Or maybe, he thought now, he just didn’t recognize
all those other girls. The way a computer
drive will spit out a disk if it doesn’t recognize
the formatting.
When he touched Eleanor’s hand, he recognized
her. He knew.
129/593
Eleanor
Disintegrated.
Like something had gone wrong beaming her
onto the Starship Enterprise.
If you’ve ever wondered what that feels like,
it’s a lot like melting – but more violent.
Even in a million different pieces, Eleanor
could still feel Park holding her hand. Could still
feel his thumb exploring her palm. She sat completely
still because she didn’t have any other option.
She tried to remember what kind of animals
paralyzed their prey before they ate them …
Maybe Park had paralyzed her with his ninja
magic, his Vulcan handhold, and now he was going
to eat her.
That would be awesome.
Park
They broke apart when the bus stopped. A flood
of reality rushed through Park, and he looked
around nervously to see if anyone had been
130/593
watching them. Then he looked nervously at
Eleanor to see if she’d noticed him looking.
She was still staring at the floor, even as she
picked up her books and stood in the aisle.
If someone had been watching, what would
they have seen? Park couldn’t imagine what his
face had looked like when he touched Eleanor.
Like somebody taking the first drink in a Diet
Pepsi commercial. Over-the-top bliss.
He stood behind her in the aisle. She was just
about his height. Her hair was pulled up, and her
neck was flushed and splotchy. He resisted the
urge to lay his cheek against it.
He walked with her all the way to her locker,
and leaned against the wall as she opened it. She
didn’t say anything, just shifted some books onto
the shelf and took down a few others.
As the buzz of touching her faded, he was
starting to realize that Eleanor hadn’t actually
done anything to touch him back. She hadn’t bent
her fingers around his. She hadn’t even looked at
him. She still hadn’t looked at him. Jesus.
131/593
He knocked gently on her locker door.
‘Hey,’ he said.
She shut the door. ‘Hey, what?’
‘Okay?’ he asked.
She nodded.
‘I’ll see you in English?’ he asked.
She nodded and walked away.
Jesus.
Eleanor
All through first and second and third hour,
Eleanor rubbed her palm.
Nothing happened.
How could it be possible that there were that
many nerve endings all in one place?
And were they always there, or did they just
flip on whenever they felt like it? Because, if
they were always there, how did she manage to
turn doorknobs without fainting?
Maybe this was why so many people said it
felt better to drive a stick shift.
132/593
Park
Jesus. Was it possible to rape somebody’s hand?
Eleanor wouldn’t look at Park during English
and history. He went to her locker after school,
but she wasn’t there.
When he got on the bus, she was already sitting
in their seat – but sitting in his spot, against
the wall. He was too embarrassed to say anything.
He sat down next to her and let his hands
hang between his knees …
Which meant she really had to reach for his
wrist, to pull his hand into hers. She wrapped her
fingers around his and touched his palm with her
thumb.
Her fingers were trembling.
Park shifted in his seat and turned his back to
the aisle.
‘Okay?’ she whispered.
He nodded, taking a deep breath. They both
stared down at their hands.
Jesus.
133/593
CHAPTER 16
Eleanor
Saturdays were the worst.
On Sundays, Eleanor could think all day
about how close it was to Monday. But Saturdays
were ten years long.
She’d already finished her homework. Some
creep had written ‘do i make you wet?’ on her
geography book, so she spent a really long time
covering it up with a black ink pen. She tried to
turn it into some kind of flower.
She watched cartoons with the little kids until
golf came on, then played double solitaire with
Maisie until they were both bored stupid.
Later, she’d listen to music. She’d saved the
last two batteries Park had given her so that she
could listen to her tape player today when she
missed him most. She had five tapes from him
now – which meant, if her batteries lasted, she
had four hundred and fifty minutes to spend with
Park in her head, holding his hand.
Maybe it was stupid, but that’s what she did
with him, even in her fantasies – even where anything
was possible. As far as Eleanor was concerned,
that just showed how wonderful it was to
hold Park’s hand.
(Besides they didn’t just hold hands. Park
touched her hands like they were something rare
and precious, like her fingers were intimately
connected to the rest of her body. Which, of
course, they were. It was hard to explain. He
made her feel like more than the sum of her
parts.)
The only bad thing about their new bus
routine was that it had seriously cut back on their
conversations. She could hardly look at Park
when he was touching her. And Park seemed to
have a hard time finishing his sentences. (Which
meant he liked her. Ha.)
135/593
Yesterday, on the way home from school,
their bus had to take a fifteen-minute detour because
of a busted sewer pipe. Steve had started
cussing about how he needed to get to his new
job at the gas station. And Park had said, ‘Wow.’
‘What?’ Eleanor sat by the wall now, because
it made her feel safer, less exposed. She could almost
pretend that they had the bus to themselves.
‘I can actually burst sewers with my mind,’
Park said.
‘That’s a very limited mutation,’ she said.
‘What do they call you?’
‘They call me … um …’ And then he’d started
laughing and pulled at one of her curls. (That
was a new, awesome development – the hair
touching. Sometimes he’d come up behind her
after school, and tug at her ponytail or tap the top
of her bun.)
‘I … don’t know what they call me,’ he said.
‘Maybe the Public Works,’ she said, laying
her hand on top of his, finger to finger. Her
136/593
fingertips came to his last knuckle. It might be
the only part of her that was smaller than him.
‘You’re like a little girl,’ he said.
‘What do you mean?’
‘Your hands. They just look …’ He took her
hand in both of his. ‘I don’t know … vulnerable.’
‘Pipemaster,’ she whispered.
‘What?’
‘That’s your superhero name. No, wait – the
Piper. Like, “Time to pay the Piper!”’
He laughed and pulled at another curl.
That was the most talking they’d done in two
weeks. She’d started to write him a letter – she’d
started it a million times – but that seemed like
such a seventh-grade thing to do. What could she
write?
‘Dear Park, I like you. You have really cute
hair.’
He did have really cute hair. Really, really.
Short in the back, but kind of long and fanned out
in the front. It was completely straight and almost
completely black, which, on Park, seemed like a
137/593
lifestyle choice. He always wore black, practically
head to toe. Black punk rock T-shirts over
black thermal long-sleeved shirts. Black sneakers.
Blue jeans. Almost all black, almost every
day. (He did have one white T-shirt, but it said
‘Black Flag’ on the front in big, black letters.)
Whenever Eleanor wore black, her mom said
that she looked like she was going to a funeral –
in a coffin. Anyway, her mom used to say stuff
like that, back when she occasionally noticed
what Eleanor was wearing. Eleanor had taken all
the safety pins from her mom’s sewing kit and
used them to pin scraps of silk and velvet over
the holes in her jeans, and her mom hadn’t even
mentioned it.
Park looked good in black. It made him look
like he was drawn in charcoal. Thick, arched,
black eyebrows. Short, black lashes. High, shining
cheeks.
‘Dear Park, I like you so much. You have
really beautiful cheeks.’
138/593
The only thing she didn’t like to think about,
about Park, was what he could possibly see in
her.
Park
The pick-up kept dying.
Park’s dad wasn’t saying anything, but Park
knew he was getting pissed.
‘Try again,’ his dad said. ‘Just listen to the
engine, then shift.’
That was an oversimplification if Park had
ever heard one. Listen to the engine, depress the
clutch, shift, gas, release, steer, check your mirrors,
signal your turn, look twice for motorcycles
…
The crappy part was that he was pretty sure
he could do it if his dad wasn’t sitting there, fuming.
Park could see himself doing it in his head
just fine.
139/593
It was like this at taekwando sometimes, too.
Park could never master something new if his
dad was the one teaching it.
Clutch, shift, gas.
The pick-up died.
‘You’re thinking too much,’ his dad snapped.
Which is what his dad always said. When
Park was a kid, he’d try to argue with him. ‘I
can’t help but think,’ Park would say during taekwando.
‘I can’t turn off my brain.’
‘If you fight like that, somebody’s going to
turn it off for you.’
Clutch, shift, grind.
‘Start it again … Now don’t think, just shift
… I said, don’t think.’
The truck died again. Park put his hands at
ten and two and laid his head on the steering
wheel, bracing himself. His dad was radiating
frustration.
‘Goddamn, Park, I don’t know what to do
with you. We’ve been working on this for a year.
I taught your brother to drive in two weeks.’
140/593
If his mom were here, she would have called
foul at this. ‘You don’t do that,’ she’d say. ‘Two
boys. Different.’
And his dad would grit his teeth.
‘I guess Josh doesn’t have any trouble not
thinking,’ Park said.
‘Call your brother stupid all you want,’ his
dad said. ‘He can drive a manual transmission.’
‘But I’m only ever gonna get to drive the Impala,’
Park muttered into the dash, ‘and it’s an
automatic.’
‘That isn’t the point,’ his dad half shouted. If
Park’s mom were here, she would have said,
‘Hey, mister, I don’t think so. You go outside and
yell at sky, you so angry.’
What did it say about Park that he wished his
mom would follow him around defending him?
That he was a pussy.
That’s what his dad thought. It’s probably
what he was thinking now. He was probably being
so quiet because he was trying not to say it
out loud.
141/593
‘Try it again,’ his dad said.
‘No, I’m done.’
‘You’re done when I say you’re done.’
‘No,’ Park said, ‘I’m done now.’
‘Well, I’m not driving us home. Try it again.’
Park started the truck. It died. His dad
slammed his giant hand against the glove box.
Park opened the truck door and jumped to the
ground. His dad shouted his name, but Park kept
walking. They were only a couple miles from
home.
If his dad drove by him on the way home,
Park didn’t notice. When he got back to his
neighborhood, at dusk, Park turned down Eleanor’s
street instead of his own. There were two
little reddish-blond kids playing in her yard, even
though it was kind of cold.
He couldn’t see into the house. Maybe if he
stood here long enough, she’d look out the window.
Park just wanted to see her face. Her big
brown eyes, her full pink lips. Her mouth kind of
looked like the Joker’s – depending on who was
142/593
drawing him – really wide and curvy. Not
psychotic, obviously … Park should never tell
her this. It definitely didn’t sound like a
compliment.
Eleanor didn’t look out the window. But the
kids were staring at him, so Park walked home.
Saturdays were the worst.
143/593
CHAPTER 17
Eleanor
Mondays were the best.
Today, when she got on the bus, Park actually
smiled at her. Like, smiled at her the whole time
she was walking down the aisle.
Eleanor couldn’t bring herself to smile directly
back at him, not in front of everybody. But
she couldn’t help but smile, so she smiled at the
floor and looked up every few seconds to see
whether he was still looking at her.
He was.
Tina was looking at her, too, but Eleanor ignored
her.
Park stood up when she got to their row, and
as soon as she sat down, he took her hand and
kissed it. It happened so fast, she didn’t have
time to die of ecstasy or embarrassment.
She let her face fall for just a few seconds
against his shoulder, against the sleeve of his
black trench coat. He squeezed her hand tight.
‘I missed you,’ he whispered. She felt tears in
her eyes and turned to the window.
They didn’t say anything more all the way to
school. Park walked with Eleanor to her locker,
and they both stood there quietly, leaning against
the wall almost until the bell rang. The hall was
practically empty.
Then Park reached up and wrapped one of her
red curls around his honey finger.
‘Back to missing you,’ he said, letting it go.
She was late to homeroom and didn’t hear Mr
Sarpy tell her that she had an office pass. He
slammed it on her desk.
‘Eleanor, wake up! You’ve got a pass from
your counselor.’ God, he was a jerk, she was glad
she didn’t have him for a real class. As she
walked to the office, she trailed her fingertips
145/593
along the brick wall and hummed a song Park
had given her.
She was so blissed out, she even smiled at
Mrs Dunne when she got to her office.
‘Eleanor,’ she said, hugging her. Mrs Dunne
was big on hugging. She’d hugged Eleanor the
very first time they met. ‘How are you?’
‘I’m good.’
‘You look good,’ Mrs Dunne said.
Eleanor looked down at her sweater (a very
fat man had probably bought it to wear golfing in
1968) and at her holey jeans. God, how bad did
she usually look? ‘Thanks, I guess.’
‘I’ve been talking to your teachers,’ Mrs
Dunne said. ‘Did you know you’re getting As in
almost all your classes?’
Eleanor shrugged. She didn’t have cable or a
phone, and she felt like she was living underground
in her own house … There was plenty of
time for homework.
‘Well, you are,’ Mrs Dunne said. ‘And I’m so
proud of you.’
146/593
Eleanor was glad there was a desk between
them now. Mrs Dunne looked like she had another
hug coming on.
‘But that’s not why I called you down here.
The reason you’re here is because I got a telephone
call for you this morning, before school
started. A man called – he said that he was your
dad – and that he was calling here because he
didn’t have your home number …’
‘I don’t actually have a home number,’
Eleanor said.
‘Ah,’ Mrs Dunne said, ‘I see. Would your
dad know that?’
‘Probably not,’ Eleanor said. She was surprised
he even knew what school she went to.
‘Would you like to call him? You could use
my office.’
Would she like to call him? Why would he
want to call her? Maybe something horrible
(something really horrible) had happened. Maybe
her grandma had died. God.
‘Sure …’ Eleanor said.
147/593
‘You know,’ Mrs Dunne said, ‘you can come
use my phone whenever you need to.’ She stood
up and sat on the edge of her desk, resting her
hand on Eleanor’s knee. Eleanor was this close to
asking for a toothbrush, but she thought that
would lead to a marathon of hugging and kneerubbing.
‘Thanks,’ Eleanor said instead.
‘Okay,’ Mrs Dunne said, beaming. ‘I’ll be
right back then. I’ll just go freshen up my
lipstick.’
When Mrs Dunne left, Eleanor dialed her
dad’s number, surprised that she still knew it by
heart. He answered after the third ring.
‘Hey, Dad. It’s Eleanor.’
‘Hey, baby, how are you?’
She thought for a second about telling him
the truth. ‘Fine,’ she said.
‘How’s everybody?’
‘Fine.’
‘You guys never call.’
148/593
There was no use telling him that they didn’t
have a phone. Or pointing out that he never
called them back when they did have a phone. Or
even saying that maybe he should find a way to
talk to them, him being the one with a phone and
a car and a life of his own.
There was no use telling her dad anything.
Eleanor had known that for so long, she couldn’t
even remember figuring it out.
‘Hey, I’ve got a cool offer for you,’ he said.
‘I thought maybe you could come over on Friday
night.’ Her dad had a voice like someone on TV,
somebody who would try to sell you record compilations.
Disco hits of the ’70s or the latest
Time-Life collection.
‘Donna wants me to go to some wedding,’ he
said, ‘and I told her you would probably watch
Matt. Thought you might like some babysitting
money.’
‘Who’s Donna?’
‘You know, Donna – Donna my fiancée. You
guys met her the last time you were here.’
149/593
That was almost a year ago. ‘Your neighbor?’
Eleanor asked.
‘Yeah, Donna. You can come over and spend
the night. Watch Matt, eat pizza, talk on the
phone … It will be the easiest ten bucks you ever
made.’
And actually the first.
‘Okay,’ Eleanor said. ‘Are you picking us
up? Do you know where we live now?’
‘I’ll pick you up at school – just you this
time. I don’t want to give you a whole house full
of kids to watch. What time do they let you out of
there?’
‘Three.’
‘Cool. I’ll see you Friday at three.’
‘All right.’
‘Well, all right. I love you, baby, study hard.’
Mrs Dunne was waiting in the doorway, with
her arms open.
Fine, Eleanor thought as she walked down the
hall. Everything is fine. Everyone is fine. She
150/593
kissed the back of her hand, just to see how it felt
on her lips.
Park
‘I’m not going to homecoming,’ Park said.
‘Of course you’re not going … To the
dance,’ Cal said. ‘I mean, it’s way too late to rent
a tux anyways.’
They were early to English class. Cal sat two
seats behind him, so Park kept having to look
back over his shoulder to see if Eleanor had
walked in yet.
‘You’re renting a tux?’ Park asked.
‘Uh, yeah,’ Cal said.
‘Nobody rents a tux for homecoming.’
‘So who’s going to look like the classiest guy
there? Besides, what do you know – you’re not
even going – to the dance, that is. The football
game, however? Different story.’
‘I don’t even like football,’ Park said, looking
back at the door.
151/593
‘Could you stop being the worst friend in the
world for, like, five minutes?’
Park looked up at the clock. ‘Yes.’
‘Please,’ Cal said, ‘do me this one favor.
There’s a whole group of cool people going, and
if you go, Kim will sit with us. You’re a Kim
magnet.’
‘Don’t you see what a problem that is?’
‘No. It’s like I’ve found the perfect bait for
my Kim trap.’
‘Stop saying her name like that.’
‘Why? She’s not here yet, is she?’
Park glanced over his shoulder. ‘Can’t you
just like a girl who likes you back?’
‘None of them like me back,’ Cal said. ‘I may
as well like the one I really want. Come on,
please. Come to the game on Friday – for me.’
‘I don’t know …’ Park said.
‘Wow, what’s up with her. She looks like she
just killed somebody for fun.’
Park whipped his head around. Eleanor. Smiling
at him.
152/593
She had the kind of smile you see in toothpaste
commercials, where you can see practically
all of somebody’s teeth. She should smile like
that all the time, Park thought; it made her face
cross over from weird to beautiful. He wanted to
make her smile like that constantly.
Mr Stessman pretended to fall against the
chalkboard when he walked in. ‘Good God,
Eleanor, stop. You’re blinding me. Is that why
you keep that smile locked away, because it’s too
powerful for mortal man?’
She looked down self-consciously and
flattened her smile into a smirk.
‘Psst,’ Cal said. Kim was sitting down
between them. Cal locked his fingers together
like he was begging. Park sighed and nodded his
head.
Eleanor
She waited for the phone call from her dad to go
sour on her. (Conversations with her dad were
153/593
like whiplash; they didn’t always hurt right
away.)
But it didn’t. Nothing could bring Eleanor
down. Nothing could drive Park’s words from
her head.
He missed her …
Who knows what he missed. Her fatness. Her
weirdness. The fact that she couldn’t talk to him
like a regular person. Whatever. Whatever perversion
caused him to like her was his problem.
But he did like her, she was sure of it.
At least for now.
For today.
He liked her. He missed her.
She was so distracted in gym class, she actually
forgot not to try. They were playing basketball,
and Eleanor caught the ball, colliding with
one of Tina’s friends, a jumpy, wiry girl named
Annette. ‘Are you trying to start something?’ Annette
demanded, pushing forward – pushing the
ball into Eleanor’s chest. ‘Are you? Come on,
then, let’s go. Come on.’ Eleanor took a few
154/593
steps back, out of bounds, and waited for Mrs
Burt to blow the whistle.
Annette stayed mad for the rest of the game,
but Eleanor didn’t let it get to her.
That feeling she used to have when she was
sitting next to Park on the bus – that feeling that
she was on base, that she was safe for the moment
– she could summon it now. Like a force
field. Like she was the Invisible Girl.
That would make Park Mr Fantastic.
155/593
CHAPTER 18
Eleanor
Her mom wasn’t going to let her babysit.
‘He has four children,’ her mother said. She
was rolling out dough for tortillas. ‘Did he forget
that?
Eleanor had stupidly told her mother about
her dad’s phone call in front of her brothers and
sister – they’d all gotten really excited. And then
Eleanor had to tell them that they weren’t invited,
that it was just babysitting, anyway, and that Dad
wasn’t even going to be there.
Mouse had started to cry, and Maisie got mad
and stormed out. Ben asked Eleanor if she’d call
Dad back to see if he could come along to help.
‘Tell him I babysit all the time,’ Ben said.
‘Your father is a piece of work,’ her mother
said. ‘Every time, he breaks your hearts. And
every time, he expects me to pick up the pieces.’
Pick up, sweep aside – same difference in her
mom’s world. Eleanor didn’t argue.
‘Please let me go,’ she said.
‘Why do you want to go?’ her mom asked.
‘Why do you even care about him? He’s never
cared about you.’
God. Even if it were true, it still hurt to hear it
that way.
‘I don’t care,’ Eleanor said. ‘I just need to get
out of here. I haven’t been anywhere but school
in two months. Plus, he said he’d pay me.’
‘If he has extra money sitting around, maybe
he should pay his child support.’
‘Mom … it’s ten dollars. Please.’
Her mother sighed. ‘Fine. I’ll talk to Richie.’
‘No. Don’t talk to Richie. He’ll just say no.
And, anyway, he can’t tell me that I can’t see my
father.’
157/593
‘Richie is the head of this household,’ her
mom said. ‘Richie is the one who puts food on
our table.’
What food? Eleanor wanted to ask. And, for
that matter, what table? They ate on the couch or
on the floor or sitting on the back steps holding
paper plates. Besides, Richie would say no just
for the pleasure of saying it. It would make him
feel like the King of Spain. Which was probably
why her mom wanted to give him the chance.
‘Mom.’ Eleanor put her face in her hand and
leaned against the refrigerator. ‘Please.’
‘Oh, fine,’ her mother said bitterly. ‘Fine. But
if he gives you any money, you can split it with
your brothers and sister. That’s the least you can
do.’
They could have it all. All Eleanor wanted
was the chance to talk to Park on the phone. To
be able to talk to him without every inbred hellspawn
in the Flats listening.
158/593
The next morning on the bus, while Park ran his
finger along the inside of her bracelet, Eleanor
asked him for his phone number.
He started laughing.
‘Why is that funny?’ she asked.
‘Because,’ he said quietly. They said
everything quietly, even though everyone else on
the bus roared, even though you’d have to shout
into a megaphone to be heard over all the cursing
and idiocy. ‘I feel like you’re hitting on me,’ he
said.
‘Maybe I shouldn’t ask for your number,’ she
said. ‘You’ve never asked for mine.’
He looked up at her through his bangs.
‘I figured you weren’t allowed to talk on the
phone … after that time with your stepdad.’
‘I probably wouldn’t be, if I had a phone.’
She usually tried not to tell Park things like that.
Like, all the things she didn’t have. She waited
for him to react, but he didn’t. He just ran his
thumb along the veins in her wrist.
‘Then why do you want my number?’
159/593
God, she thought, never mind. ‘You don’t
have to give it to me.’
He rolled his eyes and got a pen out of his
backpack, then reached over and took one of her
books.
‘No,’ she whispered, ‘don’t. I don’t want my
mom to see it.’
He frowned at her book. ‘I’d think you’d be
more worried about her seeing this.’
Eleanor looked down. Crap. Whoever wrote
that gross thing on her geography book had written
on her history book, too.
‘suck me off,’ it said, in ugly blue letters.
She grabbed Park’s pen and started scribbling
it out.
‘Why would you write that?’ he asked. ‘Is
that a song?’
‘I didn’t write it,’ she said. She could feel
patches of red creep up her neck.
‘Then who did?’
160/593
She gave him the meanest look she was capable
of. (It was hard to look at him with anything
other than gooey eyes.)
‘I don’t know,’ she said.
‘Why would anyone write that?’
‘I don’t know.’ She pulled her books against
her chest and wrapped her arms around them.
‘Hey,’ he said.
Eleanor ignored him and looked out the window.
She couldn’t believe she’d let him see that
on her book. It was one thing to let him see her
crazy life a little bit at a time … So, yeah, I have
a terrible stepdad, and I don’t have a phone, and
sometimes when we’re out of dish soap I wash
my hair with flea and tick shampoo …
It was another thing to remind him that she
was that girl. She may as well invite him to gym
class. She might as well give him an alphabetical
list of all the names they called her.
A – Ass, Fat
B – Bitch, Red-Headed
161/593
He’d probably try to ask her why she was that
girl.
‘Hey,’ he said.
She shook her head.
It wouldn’t do any good to tell him that she
hadn’t been that girl at her old school. Yeah,
she’d been made fun of before. There were always
mean boys – and there were always, always
mean girls – but she’d had friends at her old
school. She’d had people to eat lunch with and
pass notes to. People used to pick her to be on
their team in gym class just because they thought
she was nice and funny.
‘Eleanor …’ he said.
But there was no one like Park at her old
school.
There was no one like Park anywhere.
‘What,’ she said to the window.
‘How’re you going to call me if you don’t
have my number?’
‘Who said I was going to call you?’ She
hugged her books.
162/593
He leaned against her, pressing his shoulder
into hers.
‘Don’t be mad at me,’ he said, sighing. ‘It
makes me crazy.’
‘I’m never mad at you,’ she said.
‘Right.’
‘I’m not.’
‘You must just be mad near me a lot.’
She pushed her shoulder against his and
smiled despite herself.
‘I’m babysitting at my dad’s house Friday
night,’ she said, ‘and he said I could use the
phone.’
Park turned his face eagerly. It was painfully
close to hers. She could kiss him – or head-butt
him – before he’d ever have a chance to pull
away. ‘Yeah?’ he asked.
‘Yeah.’
‘Yeah,’ he said, smiling. ‘But you won’t let
me write down my number?’
‘Tell me,’ she said. ‘I’ll memorize it.’
‘Let me write it down.’
163/593
‘I’ll memorize it to the tune of a song, so that
I don’t forget.’
He started singing his number to the tune of
‘867-5309,’ which cracked her right up.
Park
Park tried to remember the first time he saw her.
Because he could remember, on that day, seeing
what everybody else saw. He could remember
thinking that she was asking for it …
That it was bad enough to have curly red hair.
That it was bad enough to have a face shaped like
a box of chocolates.
No, he hadn’t thought exactly that. He’d
thought …
That it was bad enough to have a million
freckles and chubby baby cheeks.
God, she had adorable cheeks. Dimples on
top of freckles, which shouldn’t even be allowed,
and round as crabapples. It was kind of amazing
that more people didn’t try to pinch her cheeks.
164/593
His grandma was definitely going to pinch her
when they met.
But Park hadn’t thought that either, the first
time he saw Eleanor on the bus. He remembered
thinking that it was bad enough that she looked
the way she did …
Did she have to dress like that? And act like
that? Did she have to try so hard to be different?
He remembered feeling embarrassed for her.
And now …
Now, he felt the fight rising up in his throat
whenever he thought of people making fun of
her.
When he thought of someone writing that
ugly thing on her book … it made him feel like
Bill Bixby just before he turned into the Hulk.
It had been so hard, on the bus, to pretend
that it didn’t bother him. He didn’t want to make
anything worse for her – he’d put his hands in his
pockets and pressed them into fists, and held
them that way all morning long.
165/593
All morning long, he’d wanted to punch
something. Or kick something. Park had gym
class right after lunch, and he ran so hard during
drills, he’d started to retch up his fish sandwich.
Mr Koenig, his gym teacher, made him leave
class early and take a shower. ‘Hit the bricks,
Sheridan. Now. This isn’t Chariots of Fuckin’
Fire.’
Park wished it was only righteous anger that
he felt. He wished that he could feel defensive
and protective of Eleanor without feeling …
everything else.
Without feeling like they were making fun of
him, too.
There were moments – not just today, moments
every day since they’d met – when Eleanor
made him self-conscious, when he saw people
talking and he was sure they were talking about
them. Raucous moments on the bus when he was
sure that everyone was laughing at them.
And in those moments, Park thought about
pulling back from her.
166/593
Not breaking up with her. That phrase didn’t
even seem to apply here. Just … easing away.
Recovering the six inches between them.
He’d roll the thought over in his head until
the next time he saw her.
In class, at her desk. On the bus, waiting for
him. Reading alone in the cafeteria.
Whenever he saw Eleanor, he couldn’t think
about pulling away. He couldn’t think about anything
at all.
Except touching her.
Except doing whatever he could or had to, to
make her happy.
‘What do you mean you’re not coming tonight?’
Cal said.
They were in study hall, and Cal was eating a
Snack Pack butterscotch pudding. Park tried to
keep his voice down. ‘Something came up.’
‘Something?’ Cal said, slamming his spoon
into his pudding. ‘Like you being completely
lame – is that what came up? Because that comes
up a lot lately.’
167/593
‘No. Something. Like, a girl something.’
Cal leaned in. ‘You’ve got a girl something?’
Park felt himself blush. ‘Sort of. Yeah. I can’t
really talk about it.’
‘But we had a plan,’ Cal said.
‘You had a plan,’ Park said, ‘and it was
terrible.’
‘Worst friend in the world,’ Cal said.
Eleanor
She was so nervous, she couldn’t even touch her
lunch. She gave DeNice her creamed turkey and
Beebi her fruit cocktail.
Park made her practice his phone number all
the way home.
And then he wrote it on her book anyway. He
hid it in song titles.
‘Forever Young.’
‘That’s a four,’ he said. ‘Will you
remember?’
168/593
‘I won’t have to,’ she said, ‘I already know
your number by heart.’
‘And this is just a five,’ he said, ‘because I
can’t think of any five songs, and this one’ –
‘Summer of ’69’ – ‘With this one, remember the
six, but forget the nine.’
‘I hate that song.’
‘God, I know … Hey, I can’t think of any two
songs.’
“‘Two of Us,”’ she said.
‘Two of us?’
‘It’s a Beatles song.’
‘Oh … that’s why I don’t know it.’ He wrote
it down.
‘I know your number by heart,’ she said.
‘I’m just afraid you’re going to forget it,’ he
said quietly. He pushed her hair out of her eyes
with his pen.
‘I’m not going to forget it,’ she said. Ever.
She’d probably scream out Park’s number on her
deathbed. Or have it tattooed over her heart when
169/593
he finally got sick of her. ‘I’m good with
numbers.’
‘If you don’t call me Friday night,’ he said,
‘because you can’t remember my number …’
‘How about this, I’ll give you my dad’s number,
and if I haven’t called you by nine, you can
call me.’
‘That’s an excellent idea,’ he said,
‘seriously.’
‘But you can’t call it any other time.’
‘I feel like …’ He started laughing and
looked away.
‘What?’ she asked. She elbowed him.
‘I feel like we have a date,’ he said. ‘Is that
stupid?’
‘No,’ she said.
‘Even though we’re together every day …’
‘We’re never really together,’ she said.
‘It’s like we have fifty chaperones.’
‘Hostile chaperones,’ Eleanor whispered.
‘Yeah,’ Park said.
170/593
He put his pen in his pocket, then took her
hand and held it to his chest for a minute.
It was the nicest thing she could imagine. It
made her want to have his babies and give him
both of her kidneys.
‘A date,’ he said.
‘Practically.’
171/593
CHAPTER 19
Eleanor
When she woke up that morning, she felt like it
was her birthday – like she used to feel on her
birthday, back when there was a shot in hell of
ice cream.
Maybe her dad would have ice cream … If he
did, he’d probably throw it away before Eleanor
got there. He was always dropping hints about
her weight. Well, he used to, anyway. Maybe
when he stopped caring about her altogether,
he’d stopped caring about that, too.
Eleanor put on an old striped men’s shirt and
had her mom tie one of her ties – like knot it, for
real – around her neck.
Her mom actually kissed Eleanor goodbye at
the door and told her to have fun, and to call the
neighbors if things got weird with her dad.
Right, Eleanor thought, I’ll be sure to call you
if Dad’s fiancée calls me a bitch and then makes
me use a bathroom without a door. Oh wait …
She was a little nervous. It had been a year, at
least, since she’d seen her dad, and a while before
that. He hadn’t called at all when she lived
with the Hickmans. Maybe he didn’t know she
was there. She never told him.
When Richie first started coming around, Ben
used to get really angry and say he was going to
move in with their dad – which was an empty effing
promise, and everyone knew it. Even Mouse,
who was just a toddler.
Their dad couldn’t stand having them even
for a few days. He used to pick them up from
their mom’s house, then drop them off at his
mom’s house while he went off and did whatever
it was that he did on the weekend. (Presumably,
lots and lots of marijuana.)
173/593
Park cracked up when he saw Eleanor’s tie.
That was even better than making him smile.
‘I didn’t know we were getting dressed up,’
he said when she sat down next to him.
‘I’m expecting you to take me someplace
nice,’ she said softly.
‘I will …’ he said. He took the tie in both
hands and straightened it. ‘Someday.’
He was a lot more likely to say stuff like that
on the way to school than he was on the way
home. Sometimes she wondered if he was fully
awake.
He turned practically sideways in his seat.
‘So you’re leaving right after school?’
‘Yeah.’
‘And you’ll call me as soon as you get there
…’
‘No, I’ll call you as soon as the kid settles
down. I really do have to babysit.’
‘I’m going to ask you a lot of personal questions,’
he said, leaning forward. ‘I have a list.’
‘I’m not afraid of your list.’
174/593
‘It’s extremely long,’ he said, ‘and extremely
personal.’
‘I hope you’re not expecting answers …’
He sat back in the seat and looked over at her.
‘I wish you’d go away,’ he whispered, ‘so that
we could finally talk.’
Eleanor stood on the front steps after school.
She’d hoped to catch Park before he got on the
bus, but she must have missed him.
She wasn’t sure what kind of car to watch
for; her dad was always buying classic cars, then
selling them when money got tight.
She was starting to worry that he wasn’t coming
at all – he could’ve gone to the wrong high
school or changed his mind – when he honked
for her.
He pulled up in an old Karmann Ghia convertible.
It looked like the car James Dean died
in. Her dad’s arm was hanging over the door,
holding a cigarette. ‘Eleanor!’ he shouted.
She walked to the car and got in. There weren’t
any seat belts.
175/593
‘Is that all you brought?’ he asked, looking at
her school bag.
‘It’s just one night.’ She shrugged.
‘All right,’ he said, backing out of the parking
space too fast. She’d forgotten what a crappy
driver he was. He did everything too fast and
one-handed.
Eleanor braced herself on the dashboard. It
was cold out, and once they were driving, it got
colder. ‘Can we put the top up?’ she shouted.
‘Haven’t fixed it yet,’ her dad said, and
laughed.
He still lived in the same duplex he’d lived in
since her parents split up. It was solid and brick,
and about a ten-minute drive from Eleanor’s
school.
When they got inside, he took a better look at
her.
‘Is that what all the cool kids are wearing
these days?’ he asked. She looked down at her giant
white shirt, her fat paisley tie and her halfdead
purple corduroys.
176/593
‘Yup,’ she said flatly. ‘This is pretty much
our uniform.’
Her dad’s girlfriend – fiancée – Donna, didn’t
get off work until five, and after that she had to
pick her kid up from daycare. In the meantime,
Eleanor and her dad sat on the couch and
watched ESPN.
He smoked cigarette after cigarette, and
sipped Scotch out of a short glass. Every once in
a while the phone would ring, and he’d have a
long, laughy conversation with somebody about a
car or a deal or a bet. You’d think that every
single person who called was his best friend in
the whole world. Her dad had baby blond hair
and a round, boyish face. When he smiled, which
was constantly, his whole face lit up like a billboard.
If Eleanor paid too much attention, she
hated him.
His duplex had changed since the last time
she’d been here, and it was more than just the
box of Fisher Price toys in the living room and
the makeup in the bathroom.
177/593
When they’d first started visiting him here –
after the divorce, but before Richie – their dad’s
duplex had been a bare-bones bachelor pad. He
didn’t even have enough bowls for them all to
have soup. He’d served Eleanor clam chowder
once in a highball glass. And he only had two
towels. ‘One wet,’ he’d said, ‘one dry.’
Now Eleanor fixated on all the small luxuries
strewn and tucked around the house. Packs of cigarettes,
newspapers, magazines … Brand-name
cereal and quilted toilet paper. His refrigerator
was full of things you tossed into the cart without
thinking about it just because they sounded good.
Custard-style yogurt. Grapefruit juice. Little
round cheeses individually wrapped in red wax.
She couldn’t wait for her dad to leave so that
she could start eating everything. There were
stacks of Coca-Cola cans in the pantry. She was
going to drink Coke like water all night, she
might even wash her face with it. And she was
going to order a pizza. Unless the pizza came out
of her babysitting money. (That would be just
178/593
like her dad. He’d take you to the cleaners with
fine print.) Eleanor didn’t care if eating all his
food pissed him off or if it freaked out Donna.
She might never see either of them again
anyway.
Now she wished she had brought an
overnight bag. She could have snuck home cans
of Chef Boyardee and Campbell’s chicken
noodle soup for the little kids. She would have
felt like Santa Claus when she came home …
She didn’t want to think about the little kids
right now. Or Christmas.
She tried to turn the station to MTV, but her
dad frowned at her. He was on the phone again.
‘Can I listen to records?’ she whispered.
He nodded.
She had an old mix tape in her pocket, and
she was going to dub over it to make a tape for
Park. But there was a whole packet of empty
Maxell tapes sitting on her dad’s stereo. Eleanor
held a cassette up to her dad, and he nodded,
179/593
flicking his cigarette into an ashtray shaped like a
naked African woman.
Eleanor sat down in front of the crates full of
record albums.
These used to be both of her parents’ records,
not just his. Her mom must not have wanted any
of them. Or maybe her dad just took them
without asking.
Her mom had loved this Bonnie Raitt album.
Eleanor wondered if her dad ever listened to it.
She felt seven years old, flipping through
their records.
Before she was allowed to take the albums
out of their sleeves, Eleanor used to lay them out
on the floor and stare at the artwork. When she
was old enough, her dad taught her how to dust
the records with a wood-handled velvet brush.
She could remember her mother lighting incense
and putting on her favorite records – Judee
Sill and Judy Collins and Crosby, Stills and Nash
– while she cleaned the house.
180/593
She could remember her dad putting on records
– Jimi Hendrix and Deep Purple and Jethro
Tull – when his friends came over and stayed late
into the night.
Eleanor could remember lying on her stomach
on an old Persian rug, drinking grape juice
out of a jelly jar, being extra quiet because her
baby brother was asleep in the next room – and
studying each record, one by one. Turning their
names over and over in her mouth. Cream.
Vanilla Fudge. Canned Heat.
The records smelled exactly like they always
had. Like her dad’s bedroom. Like Richie’s coat.
Like pot, Eleanor realized. Duh. She flipped
through the records more matter-of-factly now,
on a mission. Looking for Rubber Soul and
Revolver.
Sometimes it seemed as if she would never be
able to give Park anything like what he’d given
her. It was like he dumped all this treasure on her
every morning without even thinking about it,
without any sense of what it was worth.
181/593
She couldn’t repay him. She couldn’t even
appropriately thank him. How can you thank
someone for The Cure? Or the X-Men? Sometimes
it felt like she’d always be in his debt.
And then she realized that Park didn’t know
about the Beatles.
Park
Park went to the playground to play basketball
after school. Just to kill time. But he couldn’t focus
on the game – he kept looking up at the back
of Eleanor’s house.
When he got home, he called out to his mom.
‘Mom! I’m home!’
‘Park,’ she called. ‘Out here! In the garage.’
He grabbed a cherry Popsicle out of the freezer
and headed out there. He could smell the
permanent-wave solution as soon as he opened
the door.
Park’s dad had converted their garage into a
salon when Josh started kindergarten and their
182/593
mom went to beauty school. She even had a little
sign hanging by the side door. ‘Mindy’s Hair &
Nails.’
‘Min-Dae,’ it said on her driver’s license.
Everyone in the neighborhood who could afford
a hair stylist came to Park’s mom. On homecoming
and prom weekends, she’d spend all day
in the garage. Both Park and Josh were recruited
from time to time to hold hot curling irons.
Today, his mom had Tina sitting in her chair.
Tina’s hair was wound tight in rollers, and Park’s
mom was squeezing something onto them with a
plastic bottle. The smell burned his eyes.
‘Hey, Mom,’ he said. ‘Hey, Tina.’
‘Hey, honey,’ his mom said. She pronounced
it with two ‘n’s.
Tina smiled broadly at him. ‘Close eyes, Tina,’
his mom said. ‘Stay close.’
‘Hey, Mrs Sheridan,’ Tina said, holding a
white washcloth over her eyes, ‘have you met
Park’s girlfriend yet?’
183/593
His mom didn’t look up from Tina’s head.
‘Nooo,’ she said, clucking her tongue. ‘No girlfriend.
Not Park.’
‘Uh-huh,’ Tina said. ‘Tell her, Park – her
name is Eleanor, and she’s new this year. We
can’t keep them apart on the bus.’
Park stared at Tina. Shocked that she’d sell
him out like this. Startled by her rosy take on bus
life. Surprised that she was even paying attention
to him, and to Eleanor. His mom looked over at
Park, but not for long; Tina’s hair was at a critical
stage.
‘I don’t know about any girlfriend,’ his mom
said.
‘I’ll bet you’ve seen her in the neighborhood,’
Tina said, assuring. ‘She has really pretty,
red hair. Naturally curly.’
‘Is that right?’ his mom said.
‘No,’ Park said, anger and everything else
curdling in his stomach.
‘You’re such a guy, Park,’ Tina said from behind
the washcloth. ‘I’m sure it’s natural.’
184/593
‘No,’ he said, ‘she’s not my girlfriend. I don’t
have a girlfriend,’ he said to his mom.
‘Okay, okay,’ she said. ‘Too much girl talk
for you. Too much girl talk, Ti-na. You go check
on dinner now,’ she said to Park.
He backed out of the garage, still wanting to
argue, feeling more denial twitching in his throat.
He slammed the door, then went into the kitchen
and slammed as much as he could in there. The
oven. The cabinets. The trash.
‘What the hell is wrong with you?’ his dad
said, walking into the kitchen.
Park froze. He could not get into trouble
tonight.
‘Nothing,’ he said. ‘Sorry. I’m sorry.’
‘Jesus, Park, take it out on the bag …’ There
was an old-school punching bag in the garage,
hanging way out of Park’s reach.
‘Mindy!’ his dad shouted.
‘Out here!’
Eleanor didn’t call during dinner, which was
good. That got on his dad’s nerves.
185/593
But she didn’t call after dinner either. Park
walked around the house, picking things up randomly,
then setting them down. Even though it
didn’t make sense, he worried that Eleanor
wasn’t calling because he’d betrayed her. That
she knew somehow, that she’d sensed a disturbance
in the Force.
The phone rang at 7:15, and his mom
answered it. He could tell right away that it was
his grandma.
Park tapped his fingers on a bookshelf. Why
didn’t his parents want call waiting? Everyone
had call waiting. His grandparents had call waiting.
And why couldn’t his grandma just come
over, if she wanted to talk? They lived right next
door.
‘No, I don’t think so,’ his mother said. ‘Sixty
Minutes always on Sunday … Maybe you think
of Twenty-Twenty? No? … John Stos-sel? No?
… Geraldo Rivera? Di-anne Sawyer?’
Park gently banged his head against the living
room wall.
186/593
‘God damn it, Park,’ his dad snapped, ‘what
is wrong with you?’
His dad and Josh were trying to watch The ATeam.
‘Nothing,’ Park said, ‘nothing. I’m sorry. I’m
just waiting for a phone call.’
‘Is your girlfriend calling?’ Josh asked.
‘Park’s dating Big Red.’
‘She’s not—’ Park caught himself shouting
and clenched his fists. ‘If I ever hear you call her
that again, I’ll kill you. I’ll literally kill you. I’ll
go to jail for the rest of my life, and it’ll break
Mom’s heart, but I will. Kill. You.’
His dad looked at Park like he always did,
like he was trying to figure out what the fuck was
wrong with him.
‘Park has a girlfriend?’ he asked Josh. ‘Why
do they call her Big Red?’
‘I think it’s because she has red hair and giant
tits,’ Josh said.
187/593
‘No way, dirty mouth,’ their mother said. She
held her hand over the phone. ‘You’ – she pointed
at Josh – ‘in your room. Now.’
‘But, Mom, The A-Team is on.’
‘You heard your mother,’ their dad said.
‘You don’t get to talk like that in this house.’
‘You talk like that,’ Josh said, dragging himself
off the couch.
‘I’m thirty-nine years old,’ their dad said,
‘and a decorated veteran. I’ll say whatever the
hell I want.’
Their mother jabbed a long fingernail at his
dad and covered the phone again. ‘I’ll send you
to your room, too.’
‘Honey, I wish you would,’ their dad said,
throwing a throw pillow at her.
‘Hugh Downs?’ Park’s mom said into the
phone. The pillow fell on the floor and she
picked it up. ‘No? … Okay, I’ll keep thinking.
Okay. Love you. Okay, bye-bye.’
188/593
As soon as she hung up, the phone rang. Park
sprung away from the wall. His dad grinned at
him. His mom answered the phone.
‘Hello?’ she said. ‘Yes, one moment please.’
She looked at Park. ‘Telephone.’
‘Can I take it in my room?’
His mom nodded. His dad mouthed, ‘Big
Red.’
Park ran into his room, then stopped to catch
his breath before he picked up the phone. He
couldn’t. He picked it up anyway.
‘I got it, Mom, thanks.’
He waited for the click. ‘Hello?’
‘Hi,’ Eleanor said. He felt all of the tension
rush out of him. Without it, he could hardly stand
up.
‘Hi,’ he breathed.
She giggled.
‘What?’ he said.
‘I don’t know,’ she said. ‘Hi.’
‘I didn’t think you were going to call.’
‘It’s not even 7:30.’
189/593
‘Yeah, well … is your brother asleep?’
‘He’s not my brother,’ she said. ‘I mean, not
yet. I guess my dad’s engaged to his mom. But,
no, he’s not asleep. He’s watching Fraggle
Rock.’
Park carefully picked up the phone and carried
it to his bed. He sat down gently. He didn’t
want her to hear anything. He didn’t want her to
know he had a twin-sized waterbed and a phone
shaped like a Ferrari.
‘What time is your dad coming home?’ he
asked.
‘Late, I hope. They said they almost never get
a babysitter.’
‘Cool.’
She giggled again.
‘What?’ he asked.
‘I don’t know,’ she said, ‘I feel like you’re
whispering in my ear.’
‘I’m always whispering in your ear,’ he said,
lying back on his pillows.
190/593
‘Yeah, but it’s usually about, like, Magneto
or something.’ Her voice was higher on the
phone, and richer, like he was listening to it on
headphones.
‘I’m not going to say anything tonight that I
could say on the bus or during English class,’ he
said.
‘And I’m not going to say anything that I
can’t say in front of a three-year-old.’
‘Nice.’
‘I’m just kidding. He’s in the other room, and
he’s totally ignoring me.’
‘So …’ Park said.
‘So …’ she said, ‘… things we can’t say on
the bus.’
‘Things we can’t say on the bus – go.’
‘I hate those people,’ she said.
He laughed, then thought of Tina and was
glad that Eleanor couldn’t see his face. ‘Me, too,
sometimes. I mean, I guess I’m used to them.
I’ve known most of them my whole life. Steve’s
my next-door neighbor.’
191/593
‘How did that happen?’
‘What do you mean?’ he asked.
‘I mean, you don’t seem like you’re from
there …’
‘Because I’m Korean?’
‘You’re Korean?’
‘Half.’
‘I guess I don’t really know what that means.’
‘Me neither,’ he said.
‘What do you mean? Are you adopted?’
‘No. My mom’s from Korea. She just doesn’t
talk about it very much.’
‘How did she end up in the Flats?’
‘My dad. He served in Korea, they fell in
love, and he brought her back.’
‘Wow, really?’
‘Yeah.’
‘That’s pretty romantic.’
Eleanor didn’t know the half of it; his parents
were probably making out right now. ‘I guess
so,’ he said.
192/593
‘That’s not what I meant though. I meant …
that you’re different from the other people in the
neighborhood, you know?’
Of course he knew. They’d all been telling
him so his whole life. When Tina liked Park instead
of Steve in grade school, Steve had said, ‘I
think she feels safe with you because you’re like
half girl.’ Park hated football. He cried when his
dad took him pheasant hunting. Nobody in the
neighborhood could ever tell who he was dressed
as on Halloween. (‘I’m Doctor Who.’ ‘I’m Harpo
Marx.’ ‘I’m Count Floyd.’) And he kind of
wanted his mom to give him blond highlights.
Park knew he was different.
‘No,’ he said. ‘I don’t know.’
‘You …’ she said, ‘you’re so … cool.’
Eleanor
‘Cool?’ he said.
God. She couldn’t believe she’d said that.
Talk about uncool. Like the opposite of cool.
193/593
Like, if you looked up ‘cool’ in the dictionary,
there’d be a photo of some cool person there saying,
‘What the eff is wrong with you, Eleanor?’
‘I’m not cool,’ he said. ‘You’re cool.’
‘Ha,’ she said. ‘I wish I were drinking milk,
and I wish you were here, so that you could
watch it shoot out my nose in response to that.’
‘Are you kidding me?’ he said. ‘You’re Dirty
Harry.’
‘I’m dirty hairy?’
‘Like Clint Eastwood, you know?’
‘No.’
‘You don’t care what anyone thinks about
you,’ he said.
‘That’s crazy,’ she said. ‘I care what everyone
thinks about me.’
‘I can’t tell,’ he said. ‘You just seem like
yourself, no matter what’s happening around you.
My grandmother would say you’re comfortable
in your own skin.’
‘Why would she say that?’
‘Because that’s how she talks.’
194/593
‘I’m stuck in my own skin,’ Eleanor said.
‘And why are we even talking about me? We
were talking about you.’
‘I’d rather talk about you,’ he said. His voice
dropped a little. It was nice to hear just his voice
and nothing else. (Nothing besides Fraggle Rock
in the next room.) His voice was deeper than
she’d ever realized, but sort of warm in the
middle. He kind of reminded her of Peter Gabriel.
Not singing, obviously. And not with a British
accent.
‘Where did you come from?’ he asked.
‘The future.’
Park
Eleanor had an answer for everything – but she
still managed to evade most of Park’s questions.
She wouldn’t talk about her family or her
house. She wouldn’t talk about anything that
happened before she moved to the neighborhood
195/593
or anything that happened after she got off the
bus.
When her sort-of stepbrother fell asleep
around nine, she asked Park to call her back in
fifteen minutes, so she could put the kid to bed.
Park hurried to the bathroom and hoped that
he wouldn’t run into either of his parents. So far
they were leaving him alone.
He got back to his room. He checked the
clock … eight more minutes. He put a tape in his
stereo. He changed into pajama pants and a Tshirt.
He called her back.
‘It so hasn’t been fifteen minutes,’ she said.
‘I couldn’t wait. Do you want me to call you
back?’
‘No.’ Her voice was even softer now.
‘Did he stay asleep?’
‘Yeah,’ she said.
‘Where are you now?’
‘Like, where in the house?’
‘Yeah, where.’
196/593
‘Why?’ she asked, with something just
gentler than disdain.
‘Because I’m thinking about you,’ he said,
exasperated.
‘So?’
‘Because I want to feel like I’m with you,’ he
said. ‘Why do you make everything so hard?’
‘Probably because I’m so cool …’ she said.
‘Ha.’
‘I’m lying on the floor in the living room,’
she said faintly. ‘In front of the stereo.’
‘In the dark? It sounds dark.’
‘In the dark, yeah.’
He lay back on his bed again and covered his
eyes with his arm. He could see her. In his head.
He imagined green lights on a stereo. Street
lights through a window. He imagined her face
glowing, the coolest light in the room.
‘Is that U2?’ he asked. He could hear ‘Bad’ in
the background.
‘Yeah, I think it’s my favorite song right
now. I keep rewinding it, and playing it over and
197/593
over again. It’s nice not to have to worry about
batteries.’
‘What’s your favorite part?’
‘Of the song?’
‘Yeah.’
‘All of it,’ she said, ‘especially the chorus – I
mean, I guess it’s the chorus.’
‘I’m wide awake,’ he half sang.
‘Yeah …’ she said, softly.
He kept singing then. Because he wasn’t sure
what to say next.
Eleanor
‘Eleanor?’ Park said.
She didn’t answer.
‘Are you there?’
She was so out of it, she actually nodded her
head. ‘Yes,’ she said out loud, catching herself.
‘What are you thinking?’
‘I’m thinking – I’m – I’m not thinking.’
‘Not thinking in a good way? Or a bad way?’
198/593
‘I don’t know,’ she said. She rolled over onto
her stomach, and pressed her face into the carpet.
‘Both.’
He was quiet. She listened to him breathe.
She wanted to ask him to hold the phone closer to
his mouth.
‘I miss you,’ she said.
‘I’m right here.’
‘I wish you were here. Or that I was there. I
wish that there was some chance of talking like
this after tonight, or seeing each other. Like,
really seeing each other. Of being alone,
together.’
‘Why can’t there be?’ he asked.
She laughed. That’s when she realized she
was crying.
‘Eleanor …’
‘Stop. Don’t say my name like that. It only
makes it worse.’
‘Makes what worse?’
‘Everything,’ she said.
He was quiet.
199/593
She sat up and wiped her nose on her sleeve.
‘Do you have a nickname?’ he asked. That
was one of his tricks, whenever she was put off
or irritated – changing the subject in the sweetest
way possible.
‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘Eleanor.’
‘Not Nora? Or Ella? Or … Lena, you could
be Lena. Or Lenny or Elle …’
‘Are you trying to give me a nickname?’
‘No, I love your name. I don’t want to cheat
myself out of a single syllable.’
‘You’re such a dork.’ She wiped her eyes.
‘Eleanor …’ he said, ‘why can’t we see each
other?’
‘God,’ she said, ‘don’t. I’d almost stopped
crying.’
‘Tell me. Talk to me.’
‘Because,’ she said, ‘because my stepdad
would kill me.’
‘Why does he care?’
‘He doesn’t care. He just wants to kill me.’
‘Why?’
200/593
‘Stop asking that,’ she said angrily. There
was no stopping the tears now. ‘You always ask
that. Why. Like there’s an answer for everything.
Not everybody has your life, you know, or your
family. In your life, things happen for reasons.
People make sense. But that’s not my life.
Nobody in my life makes sense …’
‘Not even me?’ he asked.
‘Ha. Especially not you.’
‘Why would you say that?’ He sounded hurt.
What did he have to be hurt about?
‘Why, why, why …’ she said.
‘Yeah,’ he said, ‘why. Why are you always so
mad at me?’
‘I’m never mad at you.’ It came out a sob. He
was so stupid.
‘You are,’ he said. ‘You’re mad at me right
now. You always turn on me, just when we start
to get somewhere.’
‘Get where?’
‘Somewhere,’ he said. ‘With each other.
Like, a few minutes ago, you said you missed
201/593
me. And for maybe the first time ever, you didn’t
sound sarcastic or defensive or like you think I’m
an idiot. And now you’re yelling at me.’
‘I’m not yelling.’
‘You’re mad,’ he said. ‘Why are you mad?’
She didn’t want him to hear her cry. She held
her breath. That made it worse.
‘Eleanor …’ he said.
Even worse.
‘Stop saying that.’
‘What can I say then? You can ask me why,
you know. I promise I’ll have answers.’
He sounded frustrated with her, but not
angry. She could remember him sounding angry
with her only once. The first day she got on the
bus.
‘You can ask me why,’ he said again.
‘Yeah?’ She sniffed.
‘Yeah.’
‘Okay.’ She looked down at the turntable, at
her own reflection in the tinted acrylic lid. She
202/593
looked like a fat-faced ghost. She closed her
eyes.
‘Why do you even like me?’
Park
He opened his eyes.
He sat up, stood up, started pacing around his
small room. He went to stand by the window –
the one that faced her house, even though it was a
block away and she wasn’t home – holding the
base of the car phone against his stomach.
She’d asked him to explain something he
couldn’t even explain to himself.
‘I don’t like you,’ he said. ‘I need you.’
He waited for her to cut him down. To say
‘Ha’ or ‘God’ or ‘You sound like a Bread song.’
But she was quiet.
He crawled back onto the bed, not caring
whether she heard it swish. ‘You can ask me why
I need you,’ he whispered. He didn’t even have
to whisper. On the phone, in the dark, he just had
203/593
to move his lips and breathe. ‘But I don’t know. I
just know that I do …
‘I miss you, Eleanor. I want to be with you all
the time. You’re the smartest girl I’ve ever met,
and the funniest, and everything you do surprises
me. And I wish I could say that those are the
reasons I like you, because that would make me
sound like a really evolved human being …
‘But I think it’s got as much to do with your
hair being red and your hands being soft … and
the fact that you smell like homemade birthday
cake.’
He waited for her to say something. She
didn’t.
Someone knocked softly on his door.
‘Just a second,’ he whispered into the phone.
‘Yeah?’ he said.
His mom opened his door, just enough to
push her head through. ‘Not too late,’ she said.
‘Not too late,’ he said. She smiled and shut
the door.
‘I’m back,’ he said. ‘Are you there?’
204/593
‘I’m here,’ Eleanor said.
‘Say something.’
‘I don’t know what to say.’
‘Say something, so that I don’t feel so
stupid.’
‘Don’t feel stupid, Park,’ she said.
‘Nice.’
They were both quiet.
‘Ask me why I like you,’ she finally said.
He felt himself smile. He felt like something
warm had spilled in his chest.
‘Eleanor,’ he said, just because he liked saying
it, ‘why do you like me?’
‘I don’t like you.’
He waited. And waited …
Then he started to laugh. ‘You’re kind of
mean,’ he said.
‘Don’t laugh. It just encourages me.’
He could hear that she was smiling, too. He
could picture her. Smiling.
‘I don’t like you, Park,’ she said again. ‘I …’
She stopped. ‘I can’t do this.’
205/593
‘Why not?’
‘It’s embarrassing.’
‘So far, just for me.’
‘I’m afraid I’ll say too much,’ she said.
‘You can’t.’
‘I’m afraid I’ll tell you the truth.’
‘Eleanor …’
‘Park.’
‘You don’t like me …’ he said, leading her,
pressing the base of the phone into his lowest rib.
‘I don’t like you, Park,’ she said, sounding
for a second like she actually meant it. ‘I …’ –
her voice nearly disappeared – ‘sometimes I
think I live for you.’
He closed his eyes and arched his head back
into his pillow.
‘I don’t think I even breathe when we’re not
together,’ she whispered. ‘Which means, when I
see you on Monday morning, it’s been like sixty
hours since I’ve taken a breath. That’s probably
why I’m so crabby, and why I snap at you. All I
do when we’re apart is think about you, and all I
206/593
do when we’re together is panic. Because every
second feels so important. And because I’m so
out of control, I can’t help myself. I’m not even
mine anymore, I’m yours, and what if you decide
that you don’t want me? How could you want me
like I want you?’
He was quiet. He wanted everything she’d
just said to be the last thing he heard. He wanted
to fall asleep with ‘I want you’ in his ears.
‘God,’ she said. ‘I told you I shouldn’t talk. I
didn’t even answer your question.’
Eleanor
She hadn’t even said anything nice about him.
She hadn’t told him that he was prettier than any
girl, and that his skin was like sunshine with a
suntan.
And that’s exactly why she hadn’t said it. Because
all her feelings for him – hot and beautiful
in her heart – turned to gobbledygook in her
mouth.
207/593
She flipped the tape and pressed play, and
waited for Robert Smith to start singing before
she climbed up onto her dad’s brown leather
couch.
‘Why can’t I see you?’ Park asked. His voice
sounded raw and pure. Like something just
hatched.
‘Because my stepfather is crazy.’
‘Does he have to know?’
‘My mom will tell him.’
‘Does she have to know?’
‘Eleanor ran her fingers along the edge of the
glass coffee table. ‘What do you mean?’
‘I don’t know what I mean. I just know that I
need to see you. Like this.’
‘I’m not even allowed to talk to boys.’
‘Until when?’
‘I don’t know, never. This is one of those
things that doesn’t make sense. My mom doesn’t
want to do anything that could possibly irritate
my stepfather. And my stepfather gets off on being
mean. Especially to me. He hates me.’
208/593
‘Why?’
‘Because I hate him.’
‘Why?’
She wanted, badly, to change the subject, but
she didn’t.
‘Because he’s a bad person. Just … trust me.
He’s the kind of bad that tries to kill anything
good. If he knew about you, he’d do whatever he
could to take you away from me.’
‘He can’t take me away from you,’ Park said.
Sure he can, she thought. ‘He can take me
away from you,’ she said. ‘The last time he got
really mad at me, he kicked me out and didn’t let
me come home for a year.’
‘Jesus.’
‘Yeah.’
‘I’m sorry.’
‘Don’t be sorry,’ she said. ‘Just don’t tempt
him.’
‘We could meet at the playground.’
‘My siblings would turn me in.’
‘We could meet somewhere else.’
209/593
‘Where?’
‘Here,’ he said. ‘You could come here.’
‘What would your parents say?’
‘It’s nice to meet you, Eleanor, would you
like to stay for dinner?’
She laughed. She wanted to say it wouldn’t
work, but maybe it would. Maybe.
‘Are you sure you want them to meet me?’
she asked.
‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I want everyone to meet you.
You’re my favorite person of all time.’
He kept making her feel like it was safe to
smile. ‘I don’t want to embarrass you …’ she
said.
‘You couldn’t.’
Headlights shot across the living room.
‘Damn,’ she said. ‘I think my dad’s home.’
She got up and looked out the window. Her dad
and Donna were getting out of the Karmann
Ghia. Donna’s hair was a mess.
‘Damn, damn, damn,’ she said. ‘I never said
why I like you, and now I have to go.’
210/593
‘That’s okay,’ he said.
‘It’s because you’re kind,’ she said. ‘And because
you get all my jokes …’
‘Okay,’ he laughed.
‘And you’re smarter than I am.’
‘I am not.’
‘And you look like a protagonist.’ She was
talking as fast as she could think. ‘You look like
the person who wins in the end. You’re so pretty,
and so good. You have magic eyes,’ she
whispered. ‘And you make me feel like a
cannibal.’
‘You’re crazy.’
‘I have to go.’ She leaned over so the receiver
was close to the base.
‘Eleanor – wait,’ Park said. She could hear
her dad in the kitchen and her heartbeat
everywhere.
‘Eleanor – wait – I love you.’
‘Eleanor?’ her dad was standing in the doorway.
He was being quiet, in case she was asleep.
211/593
She hung up the phone and pretended that she
was.
212/593
CHAPTER 20
Eleanor
The next day was a blur.
Her dad complained that she’d eaten all the
yogurt.
‘I didn’t eat it, I gave it to Matt.’
Her dad only had seven dollars in his wallet,
so that’s what he gave her. When he was ready to
take her home, she said she had to go the bathroom.
She went up to the hall closet, found three
brand new toothbrushes and shoved them into the
front of her pants, along with a bar of Dove soap.
Donna might have seen her (she was right there
in the bedroom), but she didn’t say anything.
Eleanor felt sorry for Donna. Her dad never
laughed at anyone’s jokes but his own.
When her dad dropped Eleanor off at her house,
all the little kids ran out to see him. He gave them
rides around the neighborhood in his new car.
Eleanor wished she had a phone to call the
cops. ‘There’s a guy driving around the Flats
with a bunch of kids hanging out of a convertible.
I’m pretty sure none of them have seat belts on
and that he’s been drinking Scotch all morning.
Oh, and while you’re here, there’s another guy in
the backyard smoking hash. In a school zone.’
When their dad finally left, Mouse couldn’t
stop talking about him. After a few hours, Richie
told everybody to put their coats on. ‘We’re going
to a movie,’ he said, looking right at Eleanor.
‘All of us.’
Eleanor and the little kids climbed into the
back of the truck and huddled against the cab,
making faces at the baby, who got to sit inside.
Richie drove down Park’s street on the way out
of the neighborhood, but Park wasn’t outside,
thank God. Of course, Tina and her Neanderthal
214/593
boyfriend were out. Eleanor didn’t even try to
duck. What was the point? Steve whistled at her.
It was snowing on the way home from the
movie. (Short Circuit.) Richie drove slow, which
meant that even more snow fell on them, but at
least nobody flew out of the truck.
Huh, Eleanor thought. I’m not fantasizing
about being thrown from a moving vehicle.
Weird.
When they drove by Park’s house again in the
dark, she wondered which window was his.
Park
He regretted saying it. Not because it wasn’t true.
He loved her. Of course he did. There was no
other way to explain … everything Park felt.
But he hadn’t meant to tell her like that. So
soon. And over the phone. Especially knowing
how she felt about Romeo and Juliet.
Park was waiting for his little brother to
change clothes. Every Sunday, they got dressed
215/593
up, in nice pants and sweaters, and had dinner
with their grandparents. But Josh was playing Super
Mario and wouldn’t turn it off. (He was about
to get to the infinity turtle for the first time.)
‘I’m going over,’ Park yelled to his parents.
‘I’ll see you there.’
He ran across the yard because he didn’t feel
like putting on a coat.
His grandparents’ house smelled like
chicken-fried chicken. His grandma only had
four Sunday dinners in her repertoire – chickenfried
chicken, chicken-fried steak, pot roast and
corned beef – but they were all good.
His grandpa was watching TV in the living
room. Park stopped to give him half a hug, then
went into the kitchen and hugged his grandma.
She was so small, even Park towered over her.
All the women in his family were tiny, and all the
men were huge. Only Park’s DNA had missed
the memo. Maybe the Korean genes scrambled
everything.
216/593
That didn’t explain Josh’s hugeness, though.
Josh looked like the Korean genes had skipped
him altogether. His eyes were brown and just
barely almondy – almond-flavored. And his hair
was dark, but not even close to black. Josh
looked like a big German or Polish kid whose
eyes kind of crinkled when he smiled.
Their grandmother looked nothing but Irish.
Or maybe Park only thought that because everyone
in his dad’s family made such a big deal
about being Irish. Park got a ‘Kiss Me, I’m Irish’
T-shirt every year for Christmas.
He set his grandparents’ table without being
asked, because it had always been his job. When
his mom got there, he hung out in the kitchen
with her and his grandma, and listened to them
gossip about the neighbors.
‘I heard from Jamie that Park’s going steady
with one of those kids who live over with Richie
Trout,’ his grandma said.
217/593
It shouldn’t surprise Park that his dad had
already told his grandma. His dad could never
keep a secret.
‘Everybody talking about Park’s girlfriend,’
his mom said, ‘except for Park.’
‘I heard she’s a redhead,’ his grandma said.
Park pretended to read the newspaper. ‘You
shouldn’t listen to gossip, Grandma.’
‘Well, I wouldn’t have to,’ his grandma said,
‘if you’d just introduce us to her.’
He rolled his eyes. Which made him think of
Eleanor. Which almost made him feel like telling
them about her, just so he’d have a reason to say
her name.
‘Well, my heart goes out to any child living
in that house,’ his grandma said. ‘That Trout boy
has never been any good. He smashed out our
mailbox while your dad was in the service. I
know it was him because he was the only one in
the neighborhood with an El Camino. He grew
up in that little house, you know, until his parents
moved someplace even more redneck than here.
218/593
Wyoming, I think it was. They probably moved
to get away from him.’
‘Tishhhh,’ his mom said. Grandma was a
little sharp for his mom’s taste sometimes.
‘We thought he’d moved out west, too,’ she
said, ‘but now he’s back with an older wife who
looks like a movie star and a whole house full of
red-headed stepchildren. Gil told your grandpa
that they’ve got a big old dog living there, too. I
never …’
Park felt like he should defend Eleanor. But
he wasn’t sure how.
‘It doesn’t surprise me that you have a thing
for redheads,’ his grandma said. ‘Your grandfather
was in love with a redhead. Lucky for me, she
wouldn’t have anything to do with him.’
What would Park’s grandmother say if he did
introduce her to Eleanor? What would she say to
the neighbors?
And what would his mother say?
He watched his mom mash potatoes with a
masher as big as her arm. She was wearing
219/593
stonewashed jeans and a pink V-neck sweater,
with fringed leather boots. There was a gold angel
charm hanging around her neck and gold
crosses hanging from her ears. She’d be the most
popular girl on the bus. He couldn’t imagine her
living anywhere but here.
Eleanor
She’d never lied to her mother. Not about anything
important, anyway. But on Sunday night,
while Richie was at the bar, Eleanor told her
mom that she might go over to a friend’s house
after school the next day.
‘Who’s that?’ her mom asked.
‘Tina,’ Eleanor said. It was the first name she
thought of. ‘She lives in the neighborhood.’
Her mom was distracted. Richie was late, and
his steak was drying out in the oven. If she took it
out, he’d be pissed that it was cold. But if she left
it in, he’d be pissed that it was tough.
220/593
‘Okay,’ she said. ‘I’m glad you’re finally
making friends.’
221/593
CHAPTER 21
Eleanor
Would he look different?
Now that she knew that he loved her? (Or
that he had loved her, at least for a minute or two
on Friday night. At least enough to say so.)
Would he look different?
Would he look away?
He did look different. More beautiful than
ever. When she got on the bus, Park was sitting
tall in the seat, so she could see him. (Or maybe
so that he could see her.) And when he let her into
the seat, he sat back down again against her.
They both slouched down low.
‘That was the longest weekend of my life,’ he
said.
She laughed and leaned into him.
‘Are you over me?’ he asked. She wished she
could say things like that. That she could ask him
questions like that, even in a joking way.
‘Yeah,’ she said. ‘Over and over and over.’
‘Yeah?’
‘Yeah, no.’
She reached into his jacket and slipped the
Beatles tape into his T-shirt pocket. He caught
her hand and held it to his heart.
‘What’s this?’ He pulled the tape out with his
other hand.
‘The greatest songs ever written. You’re
welcome.’
He rubbed her hand against his chest. Just
barely. Just enough to make her blush.
‘Thank you,’ he said.
She waited until they were at her locker to
tell him the other thing. She didn’t want anyone
to hear. He was standing next to her and purposely
bumping his backpack into her shoulder.
‘I told my mom that I might go over to a
friend’s house after school.’
223/593
‘You did?’
‘Yeah, it doesn’t have to be today though. I
don’t think she’ll change her mind.’
‘No, today. Come over today.’
‘Don’t you have to ask your mom?’
He shook his head. ‘She doesn’t care. I can
even have girls in my room, if I keep the door
open.’
‘Girl-zzz? You’ve had enough girls in your
room to require a ruling?’
‘Oh, yeah,’ he said. ‘You know me.’
I don’t, she thought to herself, not really.
Park
For the first time in weeks, Park didn’t have that
anxious feeling in his stomach on the way home
from school, like he had to soak up enough of
Eleanor to keep him until the next day.
He had a different anxious feeling. Now that
he was actually introducing Eleanor to his mom,
224/593
he couldn’t help but see her the way his mom
was going to.
His mom was a beautician who sold Avon.
She never left the house without touching up her
mascara. When Patti Smith was on Saturday
Night Live, his mom had gotten upset – ‘Why she
want to look like man? It’s so sad.’
Eleanor, today, was wearing her sharkskin
suit jacket and an old plaid cowboy shirt. She had
more in common with his grandpa than his mom.
And it wasn’t just the clothes. It was her.
Eleanor wasn’t … nice.
She was good. She was honorable. She was
honest. She would definitely help an old lady
across the street. But nobody – not even the old
lady – would ever say, ‘Have you met that Eleanor
Douglas? What a nice girl.’
Park’s mom liked nice. She loved nice. She
liked smiling and small talk and eye contact …
All things Eleanor sucked at.
Also, his mom didn’t get sarcasm. And he
was pretty sure it wasn’t a language thing. She
225/593
just didn’t get it. She called David Letterman ‘the
ugly, mean one on after Johnny.’
Park realized that his hands were sweating
and let go of Eleanor’s. He put his hand on her
knee instead, and that felt so good, so new, he
stopped thinking about his mom for a few
minutes.
When they got to his stop, he stood in the
aisle and waited for her. But she shook her head.
‘I’ll meet you there,’ she said.
He felt relieved. And then guilty. As soon as
the bus pulled away, he ran to his house. His
brother wouldn’t be home yet, that was good.
‘Mom!’
‘In here!’ she called from the kitchen. She
was painting her nails a pearly pink.
‘Mom,’ he said. ‘Hey. Um, Eleanor’s coming
over in few minutes. My, um, my Eleanor. Now.
Is that okay?’
‘Right now?’ She shook the bottle. Click,
click, click.
226/593
‘Yeah, don’t make a big deal, okay? Just …
be cool.’
‘Okay,’ she said. ‘I’m cool.’
He nodded, then looked around the kitchen
and the living room to make sure there was nothing
weird sitting out. He checked his room, too.
His mom had made his bed.
He opened the door before Eleanor knocked.
‘Hi,’ she said. She looked nervous. Well, she
looked angry, but he was pretty sure that was because
she was nervous.
‘Hey,’ he said. This morning, all he’d been
able to think about was how to get more servings
of Eleanor into his day, but now that she was
here … he wished he had thought this through.
‘Come on in,’ he said. ‘And smile,’ he whispered
at the second-to-last second, ‘okay?’
‘What?’
‘Smile.’
‘Why?’
‘Never mind.’
227/593
His mom was standing in the doorway to the
kitchen.
‘Mom, this is Eleanor,’ he said.
His mom smiled broadly.
Eleanor smiled, too, but it was all messed up.
She looked like she was squinting into a bright
light or getting ready to tell someone bad news.
He thought he saw his mom’s pupils widen,
but he was probably imagining it.
Eleanor went to shake his mom’s hand, but
she waved them in the air, like ‘sorry my nails
are wet,’ a gesture that Eleanor didn’t seem to
recognize.
‘It’s nice to meet you, Eleanor.’ El-la-no.
‘It’s nice to meet you,’ Eleanor said, still
squinty and weird.
‘You live close enough to walk?’ his mom
asked.
Eleanor nodded.
‘That’s nice,’ his mom said.
Eleanor nodded.
‘You kids want some pop? Some snacks?’
228/593
‘No,’ Park said, cutting her off. ‘I mean …’
Eleanor shook her head.
‘We’re just going to watch some TV,’ he
said, ‘okay?’
‘Sure,’ his mom said. ‘You know where to
find me.’
She went back in the kitchen, and Park
walked over to the couch. He wished he lived in
a split-level or a house with a finished basement.
Whenever he went over to Cal’s house in west
Omaha, Cal’s mom sent them downstairs and left
them alone.
Park sat on the couch. Eleanor sat at the other
end. She was staring at the floor and chewing on
the skin around her fingernails.
He turned on MTV and took a deep breath.
After a few minutes, he scooted toward the
middle of the couch. ‘Hey,’ he said. Eleanor
stared at the coffee table. There was big bunch of
red glass grapes on the table. His mom loved
grapes. ‘Hey,’ he said again.
He scooted closer.
229/593
‘Why did you tell me to smile?’ she
whispered.
‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘Because I was
nervous.’
‘Why are you nervous? This is your house.’
‘I know, but I’ve never brought anyone like
you home before.’
She looked at the television. There was a
Wang Chung video on.
Eleanor stood up suddenly. ‘I’ll see you
tomorrow.’
‘No,’ he said. He stood up, too. ‘What?
Why?’
‘Just. I’ll see you tomorrow,’ she said.
‘No,’ he said. He took her arm by the elbow.
‘You just got here. What is it?’
She looked up at him painfully, ‘Anyone like
me?’
‘That’s not what I meant,’ he said. ‘I meant
anyone I care about.’
She took a breath and shook her head. There
were tears on her cheeks. ‘It doesn’t matter. I
230/593
shouldn’t be here, I’m going to embarrass you.
I’m going home.’
‘No,’ he pulled her closer. ‘Calm down,
okay?’
‘What if your mom sees me crying?’
‘That … wouldn’t be great, but I don’t want
you to leave.’ He was afraid that if she left now,
she’d never come back. ‘Come on, sit next to
me.’
Park sat down and pulled Eleanor down next
to him, so he was sitting between her and the
kitchen.
‘I hate meeting new people,’ she whispered.
‘Why?’
‘Because they never like me.’
‘I liked you.’
‘No, you didn’t, I had to wear you down.’
‘I like you now.’ He put his arm around her.
‘Don’t. What if your mom comes in?’
‘She won’t care.’
‘I care,’ Eleanor said, pushing him away. ‘It’s
too much. You’re making me nervous.’
231/593
‘Okay,’ he said, giving her space. ‘Just don’t
leave.’
She nodded and looked at the TV.
After a while, maybe twenty minutes, she
stood up again.
‘Stay a little longer,’ he said. ‘Don’t you want
to meet my dad?’
‘I super don’t want to meet your dad.’
‘Will you come back tomorrow?’
‘I don’t know.’
‘I wish I could walk you home.’
‘You can walk me to the door.’ He did.
‘Will you tell your mom I said goodbye? I
don’t want her to think I’m rude.’
‘Yeah.’
Eleanor stepped out onto his porch.
‘Hey,’ he said. It came out hard and frustrated.
‘I told you to smile because you’re pretty
when you smile.’
She walked to the bottom of the steps, then
looked back at him. ‘It’d be better if you thought
I was pretty when I don’t.’
232/593
‘That’s not what I meant,’ he said, but she
was walking away.
When Park went inside, his mother came out
to smile at him.
‘Your Eleanor seems nice,’ she said.
He nodded and went to his room. No, he
thought, falling onto his bed. No, she doesn’t.
Eleanor
He was probably going to break up with her tomorrow.
Whatever. At least she wouldn’t have to
meet his dad. God, what must his dad be like? He
looked just like Tom Selleck; Eleanor had seen a
family portrait sitting on their TV cabinet. Park
in grade school, by the way? Extremely cute.
Like, Webster cute. The whole family was cute.
Even his white brother.
His mom looked exactly like a doll. In The
Wizard of Oz – the book, not the movie –
Dorothy goes to this place called the Dainty China
Country, and all the people are tiny and
233/593
perfect. When Eleanor was little and her mom
read her the story, Eleanor had thought the
Dainty China people were Chinese. But they
were actually ceramic, or they’d turn ceramic, if
you tried to sneak one back to Kansas.
Eleanor imagined Park’s dad, Tom Selleck,
tucking his Dainty China person into his flak
jacket and sneaking her out of Korea.
Park’s mom made Eleanor feel like a giant.
Eleanor couldn’t be that much taller than her,
maybe three or four inches. But Eleanor was so
much bigger. If you were an alien who came to
Earth to study its life forms, you wouldn’t even
think the two of them were the same species.
When Eleanor was around girls like that –
like Park’s mom, like Tina, like most of the girls
in the neighborhood – she wondered where they
put their organs. Like, how could you have a
stomach and intestines and kidneys, and still
wear such tiny jeans? Eleanor knew that she was
fat, but she didn’t feel that fat. She could feel her
bones and muscles just underneath all the chub,
234/593
and they were big, too. Park’s mom could wear
Eleanor’s ribcage like a roomy vest.
Park was probably going to break up with her
tomorrow, and not even because she was huge.
He was going to break up with her because she
was a huge mess. Because she couldn’t even be
around regular people without freaking out.
It was just too much. Meeting his pretty, perfect
mom. Seeing his normal, perfect house.
Eleanor hadn’t known there were houses like that
in this crappy neighborhood – houses with wallto-
wall carpeting and little baskets of potpourri
everywhere. She didn’t know there were families
like that. The only upside to living in this effedup
neighborhood was that everybody else was
effed up, too. The other kids might hate Eleanor
for being big and weird, but they weren’t going
to hate on her for having a broken family and a
broke-down house. That was kind of the rule
around here.
Park’s family didn’t fit. They were the Cleavers.
And he’d told her that his grandparents lived
235/593
in the house next door, which had flower boxes,
for Christ’s sake. His family was practically the
Waltons.
Eleanor’s family had been messed up even
before Richie came around and sent everything
straight to hell.
She would never belong in Park’s living
room. She never felt like she belonged anywhere,
except for when she was lying on her bed, pretending
to be somewhere else.
236/593
CHAPTER 22
Eleanor
When Eleanor got to their seat the next morning,
Park didn’t stand up to let her in. He just scooted
over. It didn’t seem like he wanted to look at her;
he handed her some comic books, then turned
away.
Steve was being really loud. Maybe he was
always this loud. When Park was holding her
hand, Eleanor couldn’t even hear herself think.
Everyone in the back of the bus was singing
the Nebraska fight song. There was some big
game coming up this weekend, against Oklahoma
or Oregon or something. Mr Stessman was giving
them extra credit all week for wearing red. You
wouldn’t think Mr Stessman would be prone to
all this Husker crap, but it seemed like nobody
was immune.
Except Park.
Park was wearing a U2 shirt today with a picture
of a little boy on the chest. Eleanor had been
up all night thinking about how he was probably
done with her, and now she just wanted to put
herself out of her misery.
She pulled at the edge of his sleeve.
‘Yeah?’ Park said softly.
‘Are you over me?’ she asked. It didn’t come
out like a joke. Because it wasn’t.
He shook his head, but looked out the
window.
‘Are you mad at me?’ she asked.
His fingers were locked loosely together in
his lap, like he was thinking about praying. ‘Sort
of.’
‘I’m sorry,’ she said.
‘You don’t even know why I’m mad.’
‘I’m still sorry.’
He looked at her then and smiled a little.
238/593
‘Do you want to know?’ he asked.
‘No.’
‘Why not?’
‘Because it’s probably for something I can’t
help.’
‘Like what?’ he asked.
‘Like for being weird,’ she said. ‘Or … for
hyperventilating in your living room.’
‘I feel like that was partly my fault.’
‘I’m sorry,’ she said.
‘Eleanor, stop, listen, I’m mad because I feel
like you decided to leave my house as soon as
you walked in, maybe even before that.’
‘I felt like I shouldn’t be there,’ she said. She
didn’t say it loud enough to be heard over the
creeps in the back. (Seriously. Their singing was
even worse than their shouting.) ‘I didn’t feel like
you wanted me there,’ she said, a little louder.
The way Park looked at her then, biting his
bottom lip, she knew she was at least a little bit
right.
She’d wanted to be all wrong.
239/593
She’d wanted him to tell her that he did want
her at his house, that he wanted her to come back
and try again.
Park said something, but she couldn’t hear
him, because now the kids in the back were
chanting. Steve was standing at the back of the
aisle, waving his gorilla arms like a conductor.
Go. Big. Red.
Go. Big. Red.
Go. Big. Red.
She looked around. Everyone was saying it.
Go. Big. Red.
Go. Big. Red.
Eleanor’s fingertips went cold. She looked
around again, and realized that they were all
looking at her.
Go. Big. Red.
Realized that they meant it for her.
Go. Big. Red.
She looked at Park. He knew it, too. He was
staring straight ahead. His fists were clenched
240/593
tight at his sides. He looked like someone she’d
never met.
‘It’s okay,’ she said.
He closed his eyes and shook his head.
The bus was parking in front of their school,
and Eleanor couldn’t wait to get off. She forced
herself to stay in her seat until it stopped, and to
calmly walk forward. The chanting broke up into
laughter. Park was right behind her, but he
stopped as soon as he was off the bus. He threw
his backpack on the ground and took off his coat.
Eleanor stopped, too. ‘Hey,’ she said, ‘wait,
no. What are you doing?’
‘I’m ending this.’
‘No. Come on. It’s not worth it.’
‘You are,’ he said fiercely, looking at her.
‘You’re worth it.’
‘This isn’t for me,’ she said. She wanted to
pull at him, but she didn’t feel like he was hers to
hold back. ‘I don’t want this.’
‘I’m tired of them embarrassing you.’
241/593
Steve was getting off the bus, and Park
clenched his fists again.
‘Embarrassing me?’ she said. ‘Or embarrassing
you?’
He looked back at her, stricken. And she
knew again that she was right. Damn it. Why did
he keep letting her be right about all the crappy
stuff?
‘If this is for me,’ she said, as fiercely as she
could, ‘then listen to me. I don’t want this.’
He looked in her eyes. His eyes were so
green, they looked yellow. He was breathing
heavy, and his face was dark red under the gold.
‘Is it for me?’ she asked.
He nodded. He dug into her with his eyes. He
looked like he was begging for something.
‘It’s okay,’ she said. ‘Please. Let’s go to
class.’
He closed his eyes and, eventually, nodded.
She bent over to get his coat, and heard Steve
say, ‘That’s right, Red. Show it off.’
And then Park was gone.
242/593
When she turned to look, he was already
shoving Steve back toward the bus. They looked
like David and Goliath, if David had gotten close
enough to let Goliath kick his ass.
Kids were already yelling ‘fight!’ and running
from every direction. Eleanor ran, too.
She heard Park say, ‘I’m so sick of your
mouth.’
And she heard Steve say, ‘Are you serious
with this?’
He pushed Park hard, but Park didn’t fall.
Park took a few steps back, then cranked his
shoulder forward, spinning into the air and kicking
Steve right in the mouth. The whole crowd
gasped.
Tina screamed.
Steve sprung forward almost as soon as Park
landed, swinging his giant fists and clubbing Park
in the head.
Eleanor thought that she might be watching
him die.
243/593
She ran to get between them, but Tina was
already there. Then one of the bus drivers was
there. And an assistant principal. All pushing
them apart.
Park was panting and hanging his head.
Steve was holding his own mouth. There was
a waterfall of blood on his chin. ‘Jesus Christ,
Park, what the fuck? I think you knocked out my
tooth.’
Park lifted his head. His whole face was
covered with blood. He staggered forward and
the assistant principal caught him. ‘Leave … my
girlfriend … alone.’
‘I didn’t know she was really your girlfriend,’
Steve shouted. A bunch more blood spilled out of
his mouth.
‘Jesus, Steve. It shouldn’t matter.’
‘It matters,’ Steve spat. ‘You’re my friend. I
didn’t know she was your girlfriend.’
Park put his hands on his knees and shook his
head, splattering the sidewalk.
‘Well, she is.’
244/593
‘All right,’ Steve said. ‘Jesus.’
There were enough adults now to herd the
boys to the building. Eleanor carried Park’s coat
and his backpack to her locker. She didn’t know
what to do with them.
She didn’t know what to do with herself
either. She didn’t know how to feel.
Was she supposed to be happy that Park had
called her his girlfriend? It’s not like he’d given
her any choice in the matter – and it’s not like
he’d said it happily. He said it with his head
down, with his face dripping blood.
Should she be worried about him? Could he
still have brain damage, even though he’d been
talking? Could he still stroke out, or fall into a
coma? Whenever anyone in her family was fighting,
her mother would start shouting, ‘Not in the
head, not in the head!’
Also, was it wrong to be so worried about
Park’s face?
Steve had the kind of face that could take or
leave teeth. A few gaps in Steve’s smile would
245/593
just add to the big creepy goon look he was
rocking.
But Park’s face was like art. And not weird,
ugly art either. Park had the sort of face you
painted because you didn’t want history to forget
it.
Was Eleanor supposed to be mad at him still?
Was she supposed to be indignant? Was she supposed
to shout at him when she saw him in English
class, ‘Was that for me? Or for you?’
She hung his trench coat in her locker, and
leaned in to take a deep breath. It smelled like
Irish Spring and a little bit like potpourri and like
something she couldn’t describe anyway other
than boy.
Park wasn’t in English or history, and he wasn’t
on the bus after school. Neither was Steve. Tina
walked by Eleanor’s seat with her head in the air;
Eleanor looked away. Everybody else on the bus
was talking about the fight. ‘Fucking Kung Fu,
fucking David Carradine.’ And ‘Fuck David Carradine
– fucking Chuck Norris.’
246/593
Eleanor got off at Park’s stop.
Park
He was suspended for two days.
Steve was suspended for two weeks because
this was his third fight of the year. Park felt kind
of bad about that – because Park was the one
who’d started the fight – but then he thought
about all the other ridiculous crap Steve did every
day and never got busted for.
Park’s mom was so mad, she wouldn’t come
get him. She called his dad at work. When his
dad showed up, the principal thought he was
Steve’s dad.
‘Actually,’ his dad said, pointing at Park,
‘that one’s mine.’
The school nurse said Park didn’t have to go
the hospital, but he looked pretty bad. He had a
black eye and probably a broken nose.
247/593
Steve did have to go the hospital. His tooth
was loose, and the nurse was pretty sure he’d
broken a finger.
Park waited in the office with ice on his face
while his dad talked to the principal. The secretary
brought him a Sprite from the teachers’
lounge.
His dad didn’t say anything until they were
driving.
‘Taekwando is the art of self-defense,’ he
said sternly.
Park didn’t answer. His whole face was
throbbing; the nurse wasn’t allowed to give out
Tylenol.
‘Did you really kick him in the face?’ his dad
asked.
Park nodded.
‘That had to be a jump kick.’
‘Jump reverse hook,’ Park groaned.
‘No way.’
248/593
Park tried to give his dad a dirty look, but any
look at all felt like getting hit in the face with
rocks.
‘He’s lucky you wear those little tennis
shoes,’ his dad said, ‘even in the middle of winter
… Seriously, a jump reverse hook?’
Park nodded.
‘Huh. Well, your mom is going to hit the
goddamn roof when she sees you. She was at
your grandma’s house, crying, when she called
me.’
His dad was right. When Park walked in, his
mom was practically incoherent.
She took him by the shoulders and looked up
at his face, shaking her head. ‘Fighting!’ she said,
stabbing her index finger into his chest. ‘Fighting
like white-trash dumb monkey …’
He’d seen her this mad at Josh before – he’d
seen her throw a basket of silk flowers at Josh’s
head – but never at him.
‘Waste,’ she said. ‘Waste! Fighting! Can’t
trust you with own face.’
249/593
His dad tried to put his hand on her shoulder,
but she shook him off.
‘Get the boy a steak, Harold,’ his grandma
said, sitting Park at the kitchen table and inspecting
his face.
‘I’m not wasting a steak on that,’ his grandpa
said.
His dad went to the cupboard to get Park
some Tylenol and a glass of water.
‘Can you breathe?’ his grandma asked.
‘Through my mouth,’ Park said.
‘Your dad broke his nose so many times, he
can only breathe through one nostril. That’s why
he snores like a freight train.’
‘No more taekwando,’ his mom said. ‘No
more fighting.’
‘Mindy …’ his dad said. ‘It was one fight. He
was sticking up for some girl the kids pick on.’
‘She’s not some girl,’ Park growled. His
voice made every bone in his head vibrate with
pain. ‘She’s my girlfriend.’
He hoped so, anyway.
250/593
‘Is it the redhead?’ his grandma asked.
‘Eleanor,’ he said. ‘Her name – is Eleanor.’
‘No girlfriend, no,’ his mom said, folding her
arms. ‘Grounded.’
Eleanor
When Eleanor rang the doorbell, Magnum P.I.
answered.
‘Hi,’ she said, trying to smile. ‘I go to school
with Park. I have his books and stuff.’
Park’s dad looked her up and down, but not
like he was checking her out, thank God. More
like he was sizing her up. (Which was also uncomfortable.)
‘Are you Helen?’ he asked.
‘Eleanor,’ she said.
‘Eleanor, right … Just a second.’
Before she could tell him that she just wanted
to drop off Park’s stuff, he walked away. He left
the door open, and Eleanor could hear him talking
to someone, probably in the kitchen, probably
Park’s mom. ‘Come on, Mindy …’ And, ‘Just for
251/593
a few minutes …’ And then, right before he came
back to the door, ‘With a nickname like Big Red,
I expected her to be a lot bigger.’
‘I was just dropping this off,’ Eleanor said
when he pushed the screen open.
‘Thanks,’ he said, ‘come on in.’
Eleanor held up Park’s backpack.
‘Seriously, kid,’ he said. ‘Come on in and
give it to him yourself. I’m sure he wants to see
you.’
Don’t be, she thought.
But she followed him through the living
room, down the short hall to Park’s room. His
dad knocked softly and peeked in the door.
‘Hey. Sugar Ray. Someone’s here to see you.
You want to powder your nose first?’
He opened the door for Eleanor, then walked
away.
Park’s room was small, but it was packed
with stuff. Stacks of books and tapes and comic
books. Model airplanes. Model cars. Board
252/593
games. A rotating solar system hung over his bed
like one of those things you put over a crib.
Park was on his bed, trying to prop himself
up on his elbows, when she walked in.
She gasped when she saw his face. It looked
so much worse than it had earlier.
One of his eyes was swollen shut, and his
nose was thick and purple. It made her want to
cry. And to kiss him. (Because apparently
everything made her want to kiss him. Park could
tell her that he had lice and leprosy and parasitic
worms living in his mouth, and she would still
put on fresh ChapStik. God.)
‘Are you okay?’ she asked. Park nodded and
sat up against his headboard. She set down his
bag and his coat, and walked over to the bed. He
made room for her, so she sat down.
‘Whoa,’ she said, falling backwards, tipping
Park on his side. He groaned and grabbed her
arm.
‘Sorry,’ she said, ‘oh my God, sorry, are you
okay? I wasn’t expecting a waterbed.’ Just saying
253/593
that word made her giggle. Park laughed a little,
too. It sounded like snorting.
‘My mom bought it,’ he said. ‘She thinks
they’re good for your back.’
He was keeping both of his eyes mostly shut,
even the good one, and he didn’t open his mouth
when he talked.
‘Does it hurt to talk?’ she asked.
He nodded. He hadn’t let go of her arm, even
though she’d recovered her balance. If anything,
he was holding it tighter.
She reached up with her other hand and
lightly touched his hair. Brushed it out of his
face. It felt smooth and sharp at the same time,
like she could feel each strand under her
fingertips.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said.
She didn’t ask why.
There were tears pooling in the slit of his left
eye and slipping down his right cheek. She started
to wipe them away, but she didn’t want to
touch him.
254/593
‘It’s okay …’ she said. She let her hand settle
in her own lap.
She wondered if he was still trying to break
up with her. If he was, she wouldn’t hold it
against him.
‘Did I ruin everything?’ he asked.
‘Every-what?’ she whispered, as if listening
might hurt him, too.
‘Every-us.’
She shook her head, even though he probably
couldn’t see her. ‘Not. Possible,’ she said.
He ran his palm down her arm and squeezed
her hand. She could see the muscles flex in his
forearm and just under the sleeve of his T-shirt.
‘I think you might have ruined your face,’ she
said.
He groaned.
‘Which is okay,’ she said, ‘because you were
way too cute for me, anyway.’
‘You think I’m cute?’ he said thickly, pulling
on her hand.
255/593
She was glad he couldn’t see her face. ‘I
think you’re …’
Beautiful. Breathtaking. Like the person in a
Greek myth who makes one of the gods stop
caring about being a god.
Somehow the bruises and swelling made Park
even more beautiful. His face looked ready to
break out of its chrysalis.
‘They’re still going to make fun of me,’ she
blurted. ‘This fight doesn’t change that. You
can’t start kicking people every time someone
thinks I’m weird or ugly … Promise me you
won’t try. Promise me that you’ll try not to care.’
He pulled on her hand again, and shook his
head, gingerly.
‘Because it doesn’t matter to me, Park. If you
like me,’ she said, ‘I swear to God, nothing else
matters.’
He leaned back into his headboard, and
pulled her hand to his chest.
256/593
‘Eleanor, how many times do I have to tell
you,’ he said, through his teeth, ‘that I don’t like
you …’
Park was grounded, and he wouldn’t be back at
school until Friday.
But nobody bothered Eleanor the next day on
the bus. Nothing bothered her all day long.
After gym class, she found more pervy stuff
written on her chemistry book – ‘pop that
cherry,’ written in globby purple ink. Instead of
scribbling it out, Eleanor tore off the cover and
threw it away. She might be broke and pathetic,
but she could still scrounge up another brown paper
bag.
When Eleanor got home after school, her
mom followed her into the kids’ room. There
were two new pairs of Goodwill jeans folded on
the top bunk.
‘I found some money when I was doing laundry,’
her mom said. Which meant that Richie had
accidentally left money in his pants. If he came
257/593
home drunk, he’d never ask about it – he’d just
assume he spent it at the bar.
Whenever her mom found money, she tried to
spend it on things Richie would never notice.
Clothes for Eleanor. New underwear for Ben.
Cans of tuna fish and bags of flour. Things that
could be hidden in drawers and cupboards.
Her mom had become some sort of genius
double agent since she hooked up with Richie. It
was like she was keeping them all alive behind
his back.
Eleanor tried the jeans on before anybody
else got home. They were a little big, but much
nicer than anything else she had. All her other
pants had something wrong with them – a broken
zipper or a tear in the crotch – some flaw she had
to hide by constantly pulling down her shirt. It
would be nice to have jeans that didn’t do anything
worse than sag.
Maisie’s present was a bag of half-dressed
Barbies. When Maisie got home, she laid all the
258/593
dolls out on the bottom bunk, trying to put together
one or two complete outfits for them.
Eleanor climbed onto the bed with her and
helped comb and braid their frayed hair.
‘I wish there’d been a Ken in there,’ Maisie
said.
On Friday morning, when Eleanor got to her bus
stop, Park was already there waiting for her.
259/593
CHAPTER 23
Park
His eye went from purple to blue to green to
yellow.
‘How long am I grounded?’ he asked his
mother.
‘Long enough to make you sorry about fight,’
she said.
‘I am sorry,’ he said.
But he wasn’t really. The fight had changed
something on the bus. Park felt less anxious now
– more relaxed. Maybe it was because he’d stood
up to Steve. Maybe it was because he had nothing
left to hide …
Plus nobody on the bus had ever seen anybody
kick like that in real life.
‘It was pretty fantastic,’ Eleanor said on the
way to school, a few days after he came back.
‘Where did you learn to do that?’
‘My dad’s been making me go to taekwando
since kindergarten … It was actually kind of a
stupid, show-offy kick. If Steve had been thinking,
he could have grabbed my leg or pushed
me.’
‘If Steve had been thinking …’ she said.
‘I thought you’d think it was lame,’ he said.
‘I did.’
‘Lame and fantastic?’
‘Those are both your middle names …’
‘I want to try again.’
‘Try what again? Your Karate Kid thing? I
think that would be less fantastic. You’ve got to
know when to walk away …’
‘No, I want you to come over again. Would
you?’
‘It doesn’t matter,’ she said. ‘You’re
grounded.’
‘Yeah …’
261/593
Eleanor
Everybody at school knew that Eleanor was the
reason Park Sheridan kicked Steve Dixon in the
mouth.
There was a new kind of whispering when
she walked down the halls.
Somebody in geography asked her if it was
true that they were fighting over her. ‘No!’
Eleanor said. ‘For Christ’s sake.’
Later she wished that she would have said
‘Yes!’ – because if that had gotten back to Tina,
oh my God, it would have made her furious.
On the day of the fight, DeNice and Beebi
wanted Eleanor to tell them every gory detail.
Especially the gory details. DeNice even bought
Eleanor an ice cream cone to celebrate.
‘Anyone who whups Steve Dixon’s sorry ass
deserves a medal,’ DeNice said.
‘I didn’t go near Steve’s ass,’ Eleanor said.
‘But you were the cause of the ass-whupping,’
DeNice said. ‘I heard your boy kicked him
so hard, Steve cried blood.’
262/593
‘That’s not true,’ Eleanor said.
‘Girl, you need to learn a lesson about standing
in your own light,’ DeNice said. ‘If my
Jonesy kicked Steve’s ass, I’d be walking around
this place singing that song from Rocky. Nuhnuh,
nuhhh, nuh-nuh, nuhhh …’
That made Beebi giggle. Everything DeNice
said made Beebi giggle. They’d been best friends
since grade school, and the better she got to know
them, the more Eleanor felt like it was an honor
that they’d let her into their club.
Granted, it was a weird club.
DeNice was wearing her overalls today with
a pink T-shirt, pink and yellow hair ribbons and a
pink bandana tied around her leg. When they
were standing in line for ice cream, some boy
walked by and told DeNice that she looked like a
black Punky Brewster.
DeNice didn’t even flinch. ‘I don’t need to
worry about that riffraff,’ she said to Eleanor. ‘I
got a man.’
263/593
Jonesy and DeNice were engaged. He’d
already graduated and was working as an assistant
manager at ShopKo. They were getting married
as soon as DeNice was legal.
‘And your man’s fine,’ Beebi said, giggling.
When Beebi giggled, Eleanor giggled, too.
Beebi’s laugh was that contagious. And she always
had a manic, surprised look in her eyes –
that look people get when they can’t keep a
straight face.
‘Eleanor wouldn’t think he’s fine,’ DeNice
teased. ‘She’s only interested in stone-cold
killers.’
Park
‘How long am I grounded?’ Park asked his
father.
‘That’s not up to me, that’s up to your
mother.’
His dad was sitting on the couch, reading Soldier
of Fortune.
264/593
‘She says forever,’ Park said.
‘I guess it’s forever then.’
It was almost Christmas break. If Park was
grounded during Christmas break, he’d have to
go three weeks without seeing Eleanor.
‘Dad …’
‘I’ve got an idea,’ his dad said, setting down
the magazine. ‘You can be ungrounded as soon
as you learn to drive a stick. Then you can drive
your girlfriend around …’
‘What girlfriend?’ his mother said. She came
in the front door, carrying groceries. Park got up
to help her. His dad got up to give her a
welcome-home tongue kiss.
‘I told Park I’d unground him if he learned
how to drive.’
‘I know how to drive,’ Park shouted from the
kitchen.
‘Learning how to drive an automatic is like
learning how to do a girl pushup,’ his dad said.
‘No girl,’ his mother said. ‘Grounded.’
265/593
‘But for how long?’ Park asked, walking back
into the living room. His parents were sitting on
the couch. ‘You can’t ground me forever.’
‘Sure we can,’ his dad said.
‘Why?’ Park asked.
His mother looked agitated. ‘You’re grounded
until you stop thinking about that trouble
girl.’
Park and his dad both broke character to look
at her.
‘What trouble girl?’ Park asked.
‘Big Red?’ his dad asked.
‘I don’t like her,’ his mother said, adamantly.
‘She comes to my house and cries, very weird
girl, and then next thing I know, you’re kicking
friends and school is calling, face broken … And
everybody, everybody, tell me that family is
trouble. Just trouble. I don’t want it.’
Park took a breath and held it. Everything inside
of him felt too hot to let out.
‘Mindy …’ his dad said, holding a wait-aminute
hand up to Park.
266/593
‘No,’ she said, ‘no. No weird white girl in my
house.’
‘I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but weird
white girls are my only option,’ Park said as
loudly as he could. Even this angry, he couldn’t
yell at his mother.
‘There are other girls,’ his mother said.
‘Good girls.’
‘She is a good girl,’ Park said. ‘You don’t
even know her.’
His dad was standing, pushing Park toward
the door. ‘Go,’ he said sternly. ‘Go play basketball
or something.’
‘Good girls don’t dress like boys,’ his mother
said.
‘Go,’ his dad said.
Park didn’t feel like playing basketball, and it
was too cold outside without his coat. He stood in
front of his house for a few minutes, then
stomped over to his grandparents’ house. He
knocked, then opened the door; they never locked
it.
267/593
They were both in the kitchen, watching
Family Feud. His grandmother was making Polish
sausage.
‘Park!’ she said. ‘I must have known you
were coming. I made way too many Tater Tots.’
‘I thought you were grounded,’ his grandpa
said.
‘Hush, Harold, you can’t be grounded from
your own grandparents … Are you feeling okay,
honey? You look flushed.’
‘I’m just cold,’ Park said.
‘Are you staying for dinner?’
‘Yeah,’ he said.
After dinner, they watched Matlock. His
grandmother crocheted. She was working on a
blanket for somebody’s baby shower. Park stared
at the TV, but didn’t take anything in.
His grandmother had filled the wall behind
the TV with framed eight-by-ten photographs.
There were pictures of his dad and his dad’s
older brother who died in Vietnam, and pictures
of Park and Josh from every school year. There
268/593
was a smaller photo of his parents, on their wedding
day. His dad was in his dress uniform, and
his mom was wearing a pink miniskirt. Somebody
had written ‘Seoul, 1970’ in the corner. His
dad was twenty-three. His mom was eighteen,
only two years older than Park.
Everybody had thought she must be pregnant,
his dad had told him. But she wasn’t. ‘Practically
pregnant,’ his dad said, ‘but that’s a different
thing … We were just in love.’
Park hadn’t expected his mom to like Eleanor,
not right away – but he hadn’t expected her to
reject her, either. His mom was so nice to everybody.
‘Your mother’s an angel,’ his grandma always
said. It’s what everyone always said.
His grandparents sent him home after Hill
Street Blues.
His mom had gone to bed, but his dad was
sitting on the couch, waiting for him. Park tried
to walk past.
‘Sit down,’ his dad said.
Park sat down.
269/593
‘You’re not grounded anymore.’
‘Why not?’
‘It doesn’t matter why not. You’re not grounded,
and your mother is sorry, you know, for
everything she said.’
‘You’re just saying that,’ Park said.
His dad sighed. ‘Well, maybe I am. But that
doesn’t matter either. Your mother wants what’s
best for you, right? Hasn’t she always wanted
what’s best for you?’
‘I guess …’
‘So she’s just worried about you. She thinks
she can help you pick out a girlfriend the same
way she helps you pick out your classes and your
clothes …’
‘She doesn’t pick out my clothes.’
‘Jesus, Park, could you just shut up and
listen?’
Park sat quietly in the blue easy chair.
‘This is new to us, you know? Your mother’s
sorry. She’s sorry that she hurt your feelings, and
270/593
she wants you to invite your girlfriend over to
dinner.’
‘So that she can make her feel bad and
weird?’
‘Well, she is kind of weird, isn’t she?’
Park didn’t have the energy to be angry. He
sighed and let his head fall back on the chair. His
dad kept talking.
‘Isn’t that why you like her?’
Park knew he should still be mad.
He knew there were big chunks of this situation
that were completely uncool and out of
order.
But he wasn’t grounded anymore, he was going
to get to spend more time with Eleanor …
Maybe they’d even find a way to be alone. Park
couldn’t wait to tell her. He couldn’t wait for
morning.
271/593
CHAPTER 24
Eleanor
It was a terrible thing to admit. But sometimes
Eleanor slept right through the yelling.
Especially after she’d been back a couple
months. If she were to wake up every time Richie
got angry … If she got scared every time she
heard him yelling in the back room …
Sometimes Maisie would wake her up, crawling
into the top bunk. Maisie wouldn’t let Eleanor
see her cry during the day, but she shook like a
little baby and sucked her thumb at night. All five
of them had learned to cry without making any
noise. ‘It’s okay,’ Eleanor would say, hugging
her. ‘It’s okay.’
Tonight, when Eleanor woke up, she knew
something was different.
She heard the back door slam open. And she
realized that, before she’d been quite awake,
she’d heard men’s voices outside. Men cursing.
There was more slamming in the kitchen –
and then gunshots. Eleanor knew they were gunshots,
even though she’d never heard any before.
Gang members, she thought. Drug dealers.
Rapists. Gang members who were also drugdealing
rapists. She could imagine a thousand
heinous people who might have some bone to
pick out of Richie’s skull – even his friends were
scary.
She must have started to get out of bed as
soon as she heard the gunshots. She was already
on the bottom bunk, crawling over Maisie.
‘Don’t move,’ she whispered, not sure whether
Maisie was awake.
Eleanor opened the window just enough to fit
through. There wasn’t any screen. She climbed
out and ran as lightly as she could off the porch.
She stopped at the house next door – an old guy
named Gil lived there. He wore suspenders with
273/593
T-shirts and gave them dirty looks when he was
sweeping his sidewalk.
Gil took forever to answer the door, and
when he did, Eleanor realized she’d used up all
her adrenaline knocking.
‘Hi,’ she said weakly.
He looked mean and mad as spit. Gil could
dirty-look Tina right under the table, and then
he’d probably kick her.
‘Can I use your phone?’ she asked. ‘I need to
call the police.’
‘What?’ Gil barked. His hair was oiled down,
and he even wore suspenders with his pajamas.
‘I need to call 911,’ she said. She sounded
like she was trying to borrow a cup of sugar. ‘Or
maybe you could call 911 for me? There are men
in my house with … guns. Please.’
Gil didn’t seem impressed, but he let her in.
His house was really nice inside. She wondered if
he used to have a wife – or if he just really liked
ruffles. The phone was in the kitchen. ‘I think
274/593
there are men in my house,’ Eleanor told the 911
operator. ‘I heard gunshots.’
Gil didn’t tell her to leave, so she waited for
the police in his kitchen. He had a whole pan of
brownies on the counter, but he didn’t offer her
any. His refrigerator was covered with magnets
shaped like states, and he had an egg timer that
looked like a chicken. He sat at the kitchen table
and lit a cigarette. He didn’t offer her one of
those either.
When the police pulled up, Eleanor walked
out of the house, feeling silly suddenly about her
bare feet. Gil shut the door behind her.
The cops didn’t get out of their car. ‘You
called 911?’ one of them asked.
‘I think there’s somebody in my house,’ she
said shakily. ‘I heard people yelling and
gunshots.’
‘All right,’ he said. ‘Hang on a minute, and
we’ll go in with you.’
275/593
With me, Eleanor thought. She wasn’t going
back in there at all. What was she going to say to
the Hells Angels in her living room?
The police officers – two big guys in tall
black boots – parked and followed her up onto
the porch.
‘Go ahead,’ one said, ‘open the door.’
‘I can’t. It’s locked.’
‘How’d you get out?’
‘The window.’
‘Then go back through the window.’
The next time Eleanor called 911, she was
going to request cops who wouldn’t send her
alone into an occupied building. Did firemen do
this, too? Hey, kid, you go in first and unlock the
door.
She climbed in the window, climbed over
Maisie (still sleeping), ran into the living room,
opened the front door, then ran back to her room
and sat on the bottom bunk.
‘This is the police,’ she heard.
276/593
Then she heard Richie cussing, ‘What the
fuck?’
Her mom: ‘What’s going on?’
‘This is the police.’
Her brothers and sisters were waking up and
crawling to each other frantically. Someone
stepped on the baby and he started to cry.
Eleanor heard the police tramping through the
house. She heard Richie shouting. The bedroom
door flew open, and their mom came in like Mr
Rochester’s wife, in a long, torn, white
nightgown.
‘Did you call them?’ she asked Eleanor.
Eleanor nodded. ‘I heard gunshots,’ she said.
‘Shhhh,’ her mother said, rushing to the bed
and pressing her hand too hard over Eleanor’s
mouth. ‘Don’t say anything more,’ she hissed. ‘If
they ask, say it was a mistake. This was all a
mistake.’
The door opened, and her mother moved her
hand away. Two flashlights shot around the
277/593
room. Her siblings were all awake and crying.
Their eyes flashed like cats’.
‘They’re just scared,’ her mother said. ‘They
don’t know what’s happening.’
‘There’s nobody here,’ the cop said to Eleanor,
shining his light in her direction. ‘We checked
the yard and the basement.’
It was more of an accusation than an
assurance.
‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘I thought I heard
something …’
The lights went out, and Eleanor heard all
three men talking in the living room. She heard
the police officers on the porch, with their heavy
boots, and she heard them drive away. The window
was still open.
Richie came into the room then – he never
came into their room. Eleanor felt a new flood of
adrenaline.
‘What were you thinking?’ he asked softly.
She didn’t say anything. Her mother held her
hand, and Eleanor locked her jaw shut.
278/593
‘Richie, she didn’t know,’ her mom said.
‘She just heard the gun.’
‘What the fuck,’ he said, slamming his fist into
the door. The veneer splintered.
‘She thought she was protecting us, it was a
mistake.’
‘Are you trying to get rid of me?’ he shouted.
‘Did you think you could get rid of me?’
Eleanor hid her face in her mother’s shoulder.
It wasn’t a protection. It was like hiding behind
the thing in the room he was most likely to hit.
‘It was a mistake,’ her mother said gently.
‘She was trying to help.’
‘You never call them here,’ he said to Eleanor,
his voice dying, his eyes wild. ‘Never again.’
And then, shouting, ‘I can get rid of all of
you.’ He slammed the door behind him.
‘Back to bed,’ her mother said. ‘Everybody
…’
‘But, Mom …’ Eleanor whispered.
‘In bed,’ her mom said, helping Eleanor up
the ladder to her bunk. Then her mom leaned in
279/593
close, her mouth touching Eleanor’s ear. ‘It was
Richie,’ she whispered. ‘There were kids playing
basketball in the park, being loud … He was just
trying to scare them. But he doesn’t have a license,
and there are other things in the house – he
could have been arrested. No more tonight. Not a
breath.’
She knelt down with the boys for a minute,
petting and hushing, then floated out of the room.
Eleanor could swear she heard five hearts racing.
Every one of them was stifling a sob. Crying
inside out. She climbed out of her bed and into
Maisie’s.
‘It’s okay,’ she whispered to the room. ‘It’s
okay now.’
280/593
CHAPTER 25
Park
Eleanor seemed off that morning. She didn’t say
anything while they waited for the bus. When
they got on, she dropped onto their seat and
leaned against the wall.
Park pulled on her sleeve, and she not-evenhalf
smiled.
‘Okay?’ he asked.
She glanced up at him. ‘Now,’ she said.
He didn’t believe her. He pulled on her sleeve
again.
She fell against him and hid her face in his
shoulder.
Park laid his face in her hair and closed his
eyes.
‘Okay?’ he asked.
‘Almost,’ she said.
She pulled away when the bus stopped. She
never let him hold her hand once they were off
the bus. She wouldn’t touch him in the hallways.
‘People will look at us,’ she always said.
He couldn’t believe that still mattered to her.
Girls who don’t want to be looked at don’t tie
curtain tassels in their hair. They don’t wear
men’s golf shoes with the spikes still attached.
So today he stood by her locker and only
thought about touching her. He wanted to tell her
his news – but she seemed so far away, he wasn’t
sure she’d hear him.
Eleanor
Where would she go this time?
Back to the Hickmans’?
‘Hey, remember that time when my mom
asked if I could stay with you guys for a few
days, and then she didn’t come back for a year? I
really appreciate the fact that you didn’t turn me
282/593
into Child Protective Services. That was very
Christian of you. Do you still have that foldout
couch?’
Fuck.
Before Richie moved in, Eleanor only knew
that word from books and bathroom walls. Fucking
woman. Fucking kids. Fuck you, you little
bitch – who the fuck touched my stereo?
Eleanor hadn’t seen it coming the last time.
When Richie kicked her out.
She couldn’t have seen it coming because she
never thought it could happen. She never thought
he’d try – and she never, ever thought her mom
would go along with it. (Richie must have recognized
before Eleanor did that her mother’s allegiances
had shifted.)
It was embarrassing to think about the day
that it happened – embarrassing, on top of
everything else – because it really was Eleanor’s
fault. She really was asking for it.
She was in her room, typing song lyrics on an
old manual typewriter that her mom had brought
283/593
home from the Goodwill. It needed new ribbon
(Eleanor had a box full of cartridges that didn’t
fit), but it still worked. She loved everything
about that typewriter, the way the keys felt, the
sticky, crunchy noise they made. She even liked
the way it smelled, like metal and shoe polish.
She was bored that day, the day it happened.
It was too hot to do anything but lie around or
read or watch TV. Richie was in the living room.
He hadn’t gotten out of bed until 2:00 or 3:00,
and everybody could tell he was in a bad mood.
Her mom was walking around the house in
nervous circles, offering Richie lemonade and
sandwiches and aspirin. Eleanor hated it when
her mom acted like that. Relentlessly submissive.
It was humiliating to be in the same room.
So Eleanor was upstairs typing song lyrics.
‘Scarborough Fair.’
She heard Richie complaining.
‘What the fuck is that noise?’ And, ‘Fuck,
Sabrina, can’t you shut her up?’
284/593
Her mom tiptoed up the stairs and ducked her
head into Eleanor’s room. ‘Richie isn’t feeling
well,’ she said. ‘Can you put that away?’ She
looked pale and nervous. Eleanor hated that look.
She waited for her mother to get back downstairs.
Then, without really thinking about why,
Eleanor deliberately pressed a key.
A
Crunch-lap.
Her fingertips trembled over the keyboard.
RE
Crch-crch-lap-tap.
Nothing happened. No one stirred. The house
was hot and stiff and as quiet as a library in hell.
Eleanor closed her eyes and jerked her chin into
the air.
YOU GOING TO SCRABOROUGH FAIR
PARSLEY SAAGE ROSEMAYRY AND
THYME
Richie came up the stairs so fast, in Eleanor’s
head he was flying. In Eleanor’s head, he burst
open the door by hurling a ball of fire at it.
285/593
He was on her before she could brace herself,
tearing the typewriter from her hands and throwing
it into the wall so hard it broke through the
plaster and hung for a moment in the lath.
Eleanor was too shocked to make out what he
was shouting at her. FAT and FUCK and BITCH.
He’d never come this close to her before. Her
fear of him crushed her back. She didn’t want
him to see it in her eyes, so she pressed her face
into her hands in her pillow.
FAT and FUCK and BITCH. And I
WARNED YOU, SABRINA.
‘I hate you,’ Eleanor whispered into the pillow.
She could hear things slamming. She could
hear her mother in the doorway, talking softly,
like she was trying to put a baby back to sleep.
FAT and FUCK and BITCH and BEGGING
FOR IT, JUST FUCKING BEGGING FOR IT.
‘I hate you,’ Eleanor said louder. ‘I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you.’
FUCK THIS.
‘I hate you.’
286/593
FUCK ALL OF YOU.
‘Fuck you.’
STUPID BITCHES.
‘Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.’
WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY?
In Eleanor’s head, the house shook.
Her mother was pulling on her then, trying to
pull her out of bed. Eleanor tried to come with
her, but she was too scared to stand up. She
wanted to flatten herself to the floor and crawl
away. She wanted to pretend that the room was
full of smoke.
Richie was roaring. Her mother pulled Eleanor
to the top of the stairs, then pushed her down.
He was right behind them.
Eleanor fell against the banister and practically
ran to the front door on all fours. She got
outside and kept running to the end of the sidewalk.
Ben was sitting on the porch, playing with
his Hot Wheels. He stopped and watched Eleanor
run by.
287/593
Eleanor wondered if she should keep running,
but where would she go? Even when she was a
little girl, she never fantasized about running
away. She could never imagine herself past the
edge of the yard. Where would she go? Who
would take her?
When the front door opened again, Eleanor
took a few steps into the street.
It was just her mom. She took Eleanor’s arm
and started walking quickly toward the neighbor’s
house.
If Eleanor would have known then what was
about to happen, she would have run back to tell
Ben goodbye. She would have looked for Maisie
and Mouse and kissed them each hard on the
cheek. Maybe she would have asked to go back
inside to see the baby.
And if Richie had been inside waiting for her,
maybe she would have dropped to her knees and
begged him to let her stay. Maybe she would
have said anything he wanted her to.
288/593
If he wanted that now – if he wanted her to beg
for forgiveness, for mercy, if that was the price
she had to pay to stay – she’d do it.
She hoped he couldn’t see that.
She hoped none of them could see what was
left of her.
Park
She ignored Mr Stessman in English class.
In history, she stared out the window.
On the way home, she wasn’t irritable; she
wasn’t anything at all.
‘Okay?’ he asked.
She nodded her head against him.
When she got off the bus at her stop, Park
still hadn’t told her. So he jumped up and followed
her, even though he knew she wouldn’t
want him to.
‘Park …’ she said, looking nervously down
the street to her house.
289/593
‘I know,’ he said, ‘but I wanted to tell you …
I’m not grounded anymore.’
‘You’re not?’
‘Uh-uh.’ He shook his head.
‘That’s great,’ she said.
‘Yeah …’
She looked back at her house.
‘It means you can come over again,’ he said.
‘Oh,’ she said.
‘I mean, if you want to.’ This wasn’t going
like he thought it would. Even when Eleanor was
looking at him, she wasn’t looking at him.
‘Oh,’ she said.
‘Eleanor? Is everything okay?’
She nodded.
‘Do you still …’ He hung onto the backpack
straps across his chest. ‘I mean, do you still want
to? Do you still miss me?’
She nodded. She looked like she was going to
cry. Park hoped she wouldn’t cry at his house
again … If she ever came back. It felt like she
was slipping away.
290/593
‘I’m just really tired,’ she said.
291/593
CHAPTER 26
Eleanor
Did she miss him?
She wanted to lose herself in him. To tie his
arms around her like a tourniquet.
If she showed him how much she needed
him, he’d run away.
CHAPTER 27
Eleanor
Eleanor felt better the next morning. Mornings
usually got the best of her.
This morning, she woke up with that stupid
cat curled up against her like it couldn’t tell that
she’d never liked him or cats in general.
And then her mom gave her a fried egg sandwich
that Richie hadn’t wanted, and pinned an
old, chipped glass flower to Eleanor’s jacket.
‘I found it at the thrift shop,’ her mom said.
‘Maisie wanted it, but I saved it for you.’ She
smudged vanilla behind Eleanor’s ears.
‘I might go to Tina’s house after school,’
Eleanor said.
‘Okay, have fun.’
Eleanor hoped that Park would be waiting for
her at the bus stop, but she wouldn’t blame him if
he wasn’t.
He was. He was standing there in the halflight,
wearing a gray trench coat and black hightops,
and watching for her.
She ran past the last few houses to get to him.
‘Good morning,’ she said, shoving him with
both hands.
He laughed and stepped back. ‘Who are you?’
‘I’m your girlfriend,’ she said. ‘Ask
anybody.’
‘No … my girlfriend is sad and quiet and
keeps me up all night worrying about her.’
‘Bummer. Sounds like you need a different
girlfriend.’
He smiled and shook his head.
It was cold and half dark, and Eleanor could
see Park’s breath. She resisted the urge to try to
swallow it.
‘I told my mom that I was going to a friend’s
house after school …’ she said.
294/593
‘Yeah?’
Park was the only person she knew who wore
his backpack actually on his shoulders, not slung
over one side – and he was always holding onto
the straps, like he’d just jumped out of a plane or
something. It was extremely cute. Especially
when he was being shy and letting his head hang
forward.
She pulled the front of his bangs. ‘Yeah.’
‘Cool,’ he said, smiling, all shiny cheeks and
full lips.
Don’t bite his face, Eleanor told herself. It’s
disturbing and needy and never happens in situation
comedies or movies that end with big
kisses.
‘I’m sorry about yesterday,’ she said.
He hung onto his straps and shrugged.
‘Yesterday happens.’
God, it was like he wanted her to eat his face
clean off.
Park
295/593
He almost told her all the things his mom had
said about her.
It seemed like it was wrong to keep secrets
from Eleanor.
But it seemed like it would be more wrong to
share that kind of secret. It would just make
Eleanor even more nervous. She might even refuse
to come over …
And she was so happy today. She was a different
person. She kept squeezing his hand. She
even bit his shoulder when they were getting off
the bus.
Plus, if he told her, at the very least she was
going to want to go home and change. She was
wearing an orange argyle sweater today, way too
big, with her silky green tie and baggy painter’s
jeans.
Park didn’t know if Eleanor even had any
girl’s clothes – and he didn’t care. He kind of
liked that she didn’t. Maybe that was another gay
thing about him, but he didn’t think so, because
Eleanor wouldn’t look like a guy even if you cut
296/593
off her hair and gave her a mustache. All the
men’s clothes she wore just called attention to
how much of a girl she was.
He wasn’t going to tell her about his mom.
And he wasn’t going to tell her to smile. But if
she bit him again, he was going to lose
something.
‘Who are you?’ he asked, when she was still
smiling in English class.
‘Ask anybody,’ she said.
Eleanor
In Spanish class today, they were supposed to
write a letter in Spanish to a friend. Señora
Bouzon put on an episode of Qué Pasa, USA?
while they worked on it.
Eleanor tried to write a letter to Park. She
didn’t get very far.
Estimado Señor Sheridan,
Mi gusta comer su cara.
Besos,
297/593
Leonor
For the rest of the day, whenever Eleanor felt
nervous or scared, she told herself to be happy instead.
(It didn’t really make her feel better, but it
kept her from feeling worse …)
She told herself that Park’s family must be
decent people because they’d raised a person like
Park. Never mind that this principle didn’t hold
true in her own family. It wasn’t like she had to
face his family alone. Park would be there. That
was the whole point. Was there any place so horrible
that she wouldn’t go there to be with Park?
She saw him after seventh hour in a place
she’d never seen him before, carrying a microscope
down the hall on the third floor. It was at
least twice as nice as seeing him somewhere she
expected him to be.
298/593
CHAPTER 28
Park
He called his mom during lunch to tell her that
Eleanor was coming over. His counselor let him
use her phone. (Mrs Dunne loved the opportunity
to be good in a crisis, so all Park had to do was
imply that it was an emergency.)
‘I just wanted to tell you that Eleanor is coming
over after school,’ he told his mom. ‘Dad said
it was all right.’
‘Fine,’ his mother said, not even pretending
that she was okay with it. ‘Is she staying for
dinner?’
‘I don’t know,’ Park said. ‘Probably not.’
His mother sighed.
‘You have to be nice to her, you know.’
‘I’m nice to everybody,’ his mom said. ‘You
know that.’
He could tell Eleanor was nervous on the bus.
She was quiet, and she kept running her bottom
lip through her teeth, making it go white, so that
you could see that her lips had freckles, too.
Park tried to get her to talk about Watchmen;
they’d just read the fourth chapter. ‘What do you
think of the pirate story?’ he asked.
‘What pirate story?’
‘You know, there’s that character who’s always
reading a comic book about pirates, the
story within the story, the pirate story.’
‘I always skip that part,’ she said.
‘You skip it?’
‘It’s boring. Blah, blah, blah – pirates! – blah,
blah, blah.’
‘Nothing Alan Moore writes can be blahblah-
blahed,’ Park said solemnly.
Eleanor shrugged and bit her lip.
‘I’m beginning to think you shouldn’t have
started reading comics with a book that
300/593
completely deconstructs the last fifty years of the
genre,’ he said.
‘All I’m hearing is blah, blah, blah, genre.’
The bus stopped near Eleanor’s house. She
looked at him.
‘We may as well get off at my stop,’ Park
said, ‘right?’
Eleanor shrugged again.
They got off at his stop, along with Steve and
Tina and most of the people who sat at the back
of the bus. All the back-of-the-bus kids hung out
in Steve’s garage when he wasn’t at work, even
in winter.
Park and Eleanor trailed behind them.
‘I’m sorry I look so stupid today,’ she said.
‘You look like you always do,’ he said. Her
bag was hanging at the end of her arm. He tried
to take it, but she pulled away.
‘I always look stupid?’
‘That’s not what I meant …’
‘It’s what you said,’ she muttered.
301/593
He wanted to ask her not to be mad right
now. Like, anytime but now. She could be mad at
him for no reason all day tomorrow, if she
wanted to.
‘You really know how to make a girl feel
special,’ Eleanor said.
‘I’ve never pretended to know anything about
girls,’ he answered.
‘That’s not what I heard,’ she said. ‘I heard
you were allowed to have girl-zzz in your room
…’
‘They were there,’ he said, ‘but I didn’t learn
anything.’
They both stopped on his porch. He took her
bag from her and tried not to look nervous.
Eleanor was looking down the walk, like she
might bolt.
‘I meant that you don’t look any different
than you usually look,’ he said softly, just in case
his mom was standing on the other side of the
door. ‘And you always look nice.’
302/593
‘I never look nice,’ she said. Like he was an
idiot.
‘I like the way you look,’ he said. It came out
more like an argument than a compliment.
‘That doesn’t mean it’s nice.’ She was whispering,
too.
‘Fine then, you look like a hobo.’
‘A hobo?’ Her eyes lit.
‘Yeah, a gypsy hobo,’ he said. ‘You look like
you just joined the cast of Godspell.’
‘I don’t even know what that is.’
‘It’s terrible.’
She stepped closer to him. ‘I look like a
hobo?’
‘Worse,’ he said. ‘Like a sad hobo clown.’
‘And you like it?’
‘I love it.’
As soon as he said it, she broke into a smile.
And when Eleanor smiled, something broke inside
of him.
Something always did.
303/593
Eleanor
It was probably a good thing that Park’s mom
opened the door when she did because Eleanor
was thinking about kissing him, and no way was
that a good idea – Eleanor didn’t know the first
thing about kissing.
Of course, she’d watched a million kisses on
TV (thank you, Fonzie), but TV never showed
you the mechanics of it. If Eleanor tried to kiss
Park, it would be like a real-life version of some
little girl making her Barbie kiss Ken. Just
smashing their faces together.
Besides, if Park’s mom had opened the door
right in the middle of a big, awkward kiss, she’d
hate Eleanor even more.
Park’s mom did hate her, you could tell. Or
maybe she just hated the idea of Eleanor, of a girl
seducing her firstborn son right in her own living
room.
Eleanor followed Park in and sat down. She
tried to look extra polite. When his mom offered
them a snack, Eleanor said, ‘That would be great,
304/593
thank you.’ His mom was looking at Eleanor like
she was something somebody had spilled on the
baby-blue couch. She brought out cookies, then
left them alone.
Park seemed so happy. Eleanor tried to concentrate
on how nice it was to be with him – but
it was taking too much of her concentration, just
keeping herself together.
It was the little things about Park’s house that
really freaked her out. Like all the glass grapes
hanging from everything. And the curtains that
matched the sofa that matched the little doilynapkins
under the lamps.
You’d think that nobody interesting could
grow up in a house as nice and boring as this one
– but Park was the smartest, funniest guy she’d
ever met, and this was his home planet.
Eleanor wanted to feel superior to Park’s
mom and her Avon-lady house. But, instead, she
kept thinking about how nice it must be to live in
a house like this one. With your own room. And
305/593
your own parents. And six different kinds of
cookies in the cupboard.
Park
Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She
looked like art, and art wasn’t supposed to look
nice; it was supposed to make you feel
something.
Eleanor sitting next to him on the couch made
Park feel like someone had opened a window in
the middle of the room. Like someone had replaced
all the air in the room with brand new, improved
air (now with twice the freshness).
Eleanor made him feel like something was
happening. Even when they were just sitting on
the couch.
She wouldn’t let him hold her hand, not in his
house, and she wouldn’t stay for dinner. But she
agreed to come back tomorrow – if his parents
said it was okay, which they did.
306/593
His mom was being perfectly nice so far. She
wasn’t turning on the charm, like she did for her
clients and the neighbors, but she wasn’t being
rude either. And if she wanted to hide in the kitchen
every time Eleanor came over, Park
thought, that was her prerogative.
Eleanor came over again on Thursday afternoon
and Friday. And on Saturday, while they
were playing Nintendo with Josh, his dad asked
her to stay for dinner.
Park couldn’t believe it when she said yes.
His dad put the leaf into the dining room table,
and Eleanor sat right next to Park. She was
nervous, he could tell. She barely touched her
sloppy joe, and after a while her smile started to
go all grimacey around the edges.
After dinner, they all watched Back to the Future
on HBO, and his mom made popcorn. Eleanor
sat with Park on the floor, leaning against the
couch, and when he surreptitiously took her
hand, she didn’t pull away. He rubbed the inside
307/593
of her palm because he knew she liked it. It made
her eyelids dip like she was going to fall asleep.
When the movie was over, Park’s dad insisted
that Park walk Eleanor home.
‘Thanks for having me, Mr Sheridan,’ she
said. ‘And thank you for dinner, Mrs Sheridan. It
was delicious, I had a great time.’ She didn’t
even sound like she was being sarcastic.
When they got to the door, she called back,
‘Good night!’
Park closed the door behind them. You could
almost see all the nervous niceness draining out
of Eleanor. He wanted to hug her, to help wring it
out.
‘You can’t walk me home,’ she said with her
usual edge, ‘you know that, right?’
‘I know. But I can walk you partway.’
‘I don’t know …’
‘Come on,’ he said, ‘it’s dark. No one will
see us.’
‘Okay,’ she said, but she put her hands in her
pockets. They both walked slowly.
308/593
‘Your family is really great,’ she said after a
minute. ‘Really.’
He took her arm. ‘Hey, I want to show you
something.’ He pulled her into the next driveway,
between a pine tree and an RV.
‘Park, this is trespassing.’
‘It’s not. My grandparents live here.’
‘What do you want to show me?’
‘Nothing, really, I just want to be alone with
you for a minute.’
He pulled her to the back of the driveway,
where they were almost completely hidden by a
line of trees and the RV and the garage.
‘Seriously?’ she said. ‘That was so lame.’
‘I know,’ he said, turning to her. ‘Next time,
I’ll just say, “Eleanor, follow me down this dark
alley, I want to kiss you.”’
She didn’t roll her eyes. She took a breath,
then closed her mouth. He was learning how to
catch her off guard.
She pushed her hands deeper in her pockets,
so he put his hands on her elbows instead. ‘Next
309/593
time,’ he said, ‘I’ll just say, “Eleanor, duck behind
these bushes with me, I’m going to lose my
mind if I don’t kiss you.”’
She didn’t move, so he thought it was probably
okay to touch her face. Her skin was as soft
as it looked, white and smooth as freckled
porcelain.
‘I’ll just say, “Eleanor, follow me down this
rabbit hole …”’
He laid his thumb on her lips to see if she’d
pull away. She didn’t. He leaned closer. He
wanted to close his eyes, but he didn’t trust her
not to leave him standing there.
When his lips were almost touching hers, she
shook her head. Her nose rubbed against his.
‘I’ve never done this before,’ she said.
‘S’okay,’ he said.
‘It’s not, it’s going to be terrible.’
He shook his head. ‘It’s not.’
She shook her head a little more. Just a little.
‘You’re going to regret this,’ she said.
310/593
That made him laugh, so he had to wait a
second before he kissed her.
It wasn’t terrible. Eleanor’s lips were soft and
warm, and he could feel her pulse in her cheek. It
was good that she was so nervous – because it
forced him not to be. It steadied him to feel her
trembling.
He pulled away before he wanted to. He
hadn’t done this enough to know how to breathe.
When he pulled away, her eyes were mostly
closed. His grandparents had a light on, on their
front porch, and Eleanor’s face caught every bit
of it. She looked like she should be married to the
man in the moon.
Her face dropped after a second, and he let
his hand fall to her shoulder.
‘Okay?’ he whispered.
She nodded. He pulled her closer and kissed
the top her head. He tried to find her ear under all
that hair.
‘Come here,’ he said, ‘I want to show you
something.’
311/593
She laughed. He lifted her chin.
The second time was even less terrible.
Eleanor
They walked together from his grandparents’
driveway to the alley, then Park waited there in
the shadows and watched Eleanor walk home
alone.
She told herself not to look back.
Richie was home, and everybody except her
mom was watching TV. It wasn’t that late;
Eleanor tried to act like there was nothing strange
about her coming home in the dark.
‘Where have you been?’ Richie said.
‘At a friend’s house.’
‘What friend?’
‘I told you, honey,’ her mom said, stepping
into the room, drying a pan. ‘Eleanor has a girlfriend
in the neighborhood. Lisa.’
‘Tina,’ Eleanor said.
312/593
‘Girlfriend, huh?’ Richie said. ‘Giving up on
men already?’ He thought that was pretty funny.
Eleanor went into the bedroom and closed the
door. She didn’t turn on the light. She climbed
into bed in her street clothes, opened the curtains
and wiped the condensation off the window. She
couldn’t see the alley or anything moving
outside.
The window fogged over again. Eleanor
closed her eyes and laid her forehead against the
glass.
313/593
CHAPTER 29
Eleanor
When she saw Park standing at the bus stop on
Monday morning, she started giggling. Seriously,
giggling like a cartoon character … when their
cheeks get all red, and little hearts start popping
out of their ears …
It was ridiculous.
Park
When he saw Eleanor walking toward him on
Monday morning, Park wanted to run to her and
sweep her up in his arms. Like some guy in the
soap operas his mom watched. He hung onto his
backpack to hold himself back …
It was kind of wonderful.
Eleanor
Park was just her height, but he seemed taller.
Park
Eleanor’s eyelashes were the same color as her
freckles.
Eleanor
They talked about The White Album on the way
to school, but just as an excuse to stare at each
other’s mouths. You’d think they were lipreading.
Maybe that’s why Park kept laughing, even
when they were talking about ‘Helter Skelter’ –
which wasn’t the Beatles’ funniest song, even before
Charles Manson got a hold of it.
315/593
CHAPTER 30
Park
‘Hey,’ Cal said, taking a bite out of his Rib-a-
Que sandwich. ‘You should come to the basketball
game with us Thursday. And don’t even try
to tell me you don’t like basketball, Spud.’
‘I don’t know …’
‘Kim’s going to be there.’
Park groaned. ‘Cal …’
‘Sitting next to me,’ Cal said. ‘Because we’re
totally going out.’
‘Wait, seriously?’ Park covered his mouth to
keep a chunk of sandwich from flying out. ‘Are
we talking about the same Kim?’
‘Is that so hard to believe?’ Cal opened his
carton of milk completely and drank out of it like
a cup. ‘She wasn’t even into you, you know. She
was just bored, and she thought you were mysterious
and quiet – like, “still waters run deep.” I
told her that sometimes still waters just run still.’
‘Thanks.’
‘But she’s totally into me now, so you can
hang out with us if you want. The basketball
games are a blast. They sell nachos and
everything.’
‘I’ll think about it,’ Park said.
He wasn’t going to think about it. He wasn’t
going anywhere without Eleanor. And she didn’t
seem like the basketball game type.
Eleanor
‘Hey, girl,’ DeNice said after gym class. They
were in the locker room, changing back into their
street clothes. ‘So I’ve been thinking, you’ve got
to go to Sprite Nite with us this week. Jonesy’s
got his car fixed, and he’s got this Thursday off.
We are going to do it right, right, right, all
through the night, night, night.’
317/593
‘You know I’m not allowed to go out,’ Eleanor
said.
‘I know that you’re not allowed to go to your
boyfriend’s house either,’ DeNice said.
‘I heard that,’ Beebi said.
Eleanor should never have told them about
Park’s house, but she’d been dying to tell somebody.
(This was how people ended up in jail after
committing the perfect crime.) ‘Keep it down,’
she said. ‘God.’
‘You should come,’ Beebi said. Her face was
perfectly round, with dimples so deep that when
she smiled she looked tufted, like a cushion. ‘We
have so much fun. I’ll bet you’ve never even
been dancing before.’
‘I don’t know …’ Eleanor said.
‘Is this about your man?’ DeNice asked. ‘Because
he can come, too. He don’t take up much
space.’
Beebi giggled, so Eleanor giggled, too. She
couldn’t imagine Park dancing. He’d probably be
318/593
really good at it, if all the Top 40 music didn’t
make his ears bleed. He was good at everything.
Still … She couldn’t imagine the two of them
going out with DeNice or Beebi. Or anybody.
Thinking about going out with Park, in public,
was kind of like thinking about taking your helmet
off in space.
Park
His mom said that if they were going to hang out
every night after school, which they definitely
were, they had to start doing homework.
‘She’s probably right,’ Eleanor said on the
bus. ‘I’ve been faking it in English all week.’
‘You were faking it today? Seriously? It
didn’t sound like it.’
‘We did Shakespeare last year at my old
school … But I can’t fake it in math. I can’t even
… what’s the opposite of faking it?’
‘I can help you with your math, you know.
I’m already through algebra.’
319/593
‘Gosh, Wally, that’d be dreamy.’
‘Or not,’ he said. ‘I could not help you with
your math.’
Even her mean, smirky smile made him
crazy.
They tried to study in the living room, but Josh
wanted to watch TV, so they took their stuff into
the kitchen.
His mom said it was okay; then said she had
stuff to do in the garage. Whatever.
Eleanor moved her lips when she read …
Park kicked her gently under the table, and
threw crumpled-up pieces of paper into her hair.
They were almost never alone, and now that they
almost-practically were, he felt kind of frantic for
her attention.
He flipped her algebra book closed with his
pen.
‘Seriously?’ She tried to open it again.
‘No,’ he said, pulling it toward him.
‘I thought we were studying.’
‘I know,’ he said, ‘I just … we’re alone.’
320/593
‘Sort of …’
‘So we should be doing alone things.’
‘You sound so creepy right now …’
‘I meant talking.’ He wasn’t sure what he
meant. He looked down at the table. Eleanor’s algebra
book was covered with her handwriting,
the lyrics to one song wrapped and coiled around
the title of another. He saw his name written in
tiny cursive letters – your own name always
stands out – and hidden in the chorus of a Smiths
song.
He felt himself grin.
‘What?’ Eleanor asked.
‘Nothing.’
‘What.’
He looked back at the book. He was going to
think about this later, after she went home. He
was going to think about Eleanor sitting in class,
thinking about him, carefully writing his name
someplace she thought only she would see.
321/593
And then he noticed something else. Written
just as small, just as carefully, in all lowercase
letters. ‘i know your a slut you smell like cum.’
‘What,’ Eleanor said, trying to pull the book
away. Park held onto it. He felt the Bruce Banner
blood rushing to his face.
‘Why didn’t you tell me that this was still
happening?’
‘That what was still happening?’
He didn’t want to say it, he didn’t want to
point to it. He didn’t want their eyes on those
words together.
‘This,’ he said, waving his hand over the
words.
She looked – and immediately started scrubbing
the bad writing out with her pen. Her face
was skim milk, and her neck went red and
blotchy.
‘Why didn’t you tell me?’ he said.
‘I didn’t know it was there.’
‘I thought this had stopped.’
‘Why would you think that?’
322/593
Why had he thought that? Because she was
with him now?
‘I just … why didn’t you tell me about this?’
‘Why would I tell you?’ she asked. ‘It’s gross
and embarrassing.’
She was still scribbling. He put his hand over
her wrist. ‘Maybe I could help.’
‘Help how?’ She shoved the book toward
him. ‘Do you want to kick it?’
He clenched his teeth. She took the book
back and put it in her bag.
‘Do you know who’s doing it?’ he asked.
‘Are you going to kick them?’
‘Maybe …’
‘Well …’ she said, ‘I’ve narrowed it down to
people who don’t like me …’
‘It couldn’t be just anyone. It would have to
be somebody who could get to your books
without you knowing about it.’
Ten seconds ago, Eleanor had looked mean as
a cat. Now she looked resigned, slumped over the
table with her fingertips at her temples.
323/593
‘I don’t know …’ She shook her head. ‘It
seems like it always happens on gym days.’
‘Do you leave your books in the locker
room?’
She rubbed her eyes with both hands. ‘I feel
like now you’re intentionally asking me stupid
questions. You’re like the worst detective ever.’
‘Who doesn’t like you in gym class?’
‘Ha.’ She was still covering her face. ‘Who
doesn’t like me in gym class.’
‘You need to take this seriously,’ he said.
‘No,’ she said firmly, squeezing her hands into
fists, ‘this is exactly the sort of thing I
shouldn’t take seriously. That’s exactly what
Tina and her henchgirls want me to do. If they
think they’re getting to me? They’ll never leave
me alone.’
‘What does Tina have to do with this?’
‘Tina is the queen of the people in my gym
class who don’t like me.’
‘Tina would never do anything this bad.’
324/593
Eleanor looked hard at him. ‘Are you kidding?
Tina’s a monster. She’s what would happen
if the devil married the wicked witch, and
they rolled their baby in a bowl of chopped evil.’
Park thought of the Tina who sold him out in
the garage and made fun of people on the bus …
But then he thought of all the times that Steve
had gone after Park, and Tina had pulled him
back.
‘I’ve known Tina since we were kids,’ he
said. ‘She’s not that bad. We used to be friends.’
‘You don’t act like friends.’
‘Well, she’s dating Steve now.’
‘Why does that matter?’
Park couldn’t think of how to answer.
‘Why does it matter?’ Eleanor’s eyes were
dark slits in her face. If he lied to her about this,
she’d never forgive him.
‘None of it matters now,’ he said. ‘It’s stupid
… Tina and I went together in the sixth grade.
Not that we ever went anywhere or did anything.’
‘Tina? You went with Tina?’
325/593
‘It was the sixth grade. It was nothing.’
‘But you were boyfriend and girlfriend? Did
you hold hands?’
‘I don’t remember.’
‘Did you kiss her?’
‘None of this matters.’
But it did. Because it was making Eleanor
look at him like he was a stranger. It was making
him feel like a stranger. He knew that Tina had a
mean streak, but he also knew that she wouldn’t
go this far.
What did he know about Eleanor? Not much.
It was like she didn’t want him to know her better.
He felt everything for Eleanor, but what did
he really know?
‘You always write in lowercase letters …’
Saying this out loud seemed like a good idea only
for as long as the words were on his tongue, but
he kept talking. ‘Did you write those things
yourself?’
326/593
Eleanor paled from pale to ashen. It was like
all the blood in her body rushed to her heart, all
at once. Her speckled lips hung open.
Then she snapped out of it. She started stacking
her books.
‘If I were going to write a note to myself,
calling myself a dirty slut,’ she said it matter-offactly,
‘you’re right, I might not use capital letters.
But I would definitely use an apostrophe …
and probably a period. I’m a huge fan of
punctuation.’
‘What are you doing?’ he asked.
She shook her head and stood up. He couldn’t
for the life of him think of how to stop her.
‘I don’t know who’s been writing on my
books,’ she said coolly. ‘But I think we just
solved the mystery of why Tina hates me so
much.’
‘Eleanor …’
‘No,’ she said, her voice catching. ‘I don’t
want to talk anymore.’
327/593
She walked out of the kitchen, just as Park’s
mom was coming in from garage. His mom
looked at Park with a face he was beginning to
recognize. What do you see in this weird white
girl?
Park
That night, Park lay in bed thinking about Eleanor
thinking about him, writing his name on her
book.
She’d probably already scribbled that out,
too.
He tried to think about why he’d defended
Tina.
Why did it matter to him whether Tina was
good or bad? Eleanor was right, he and Tina weren’t
friends. They weren’t anything like friends.
They hadn’t even been friends in the sixth grade.
Tina had asked Park to go with her, and Park
had said yes – because everybody knew that Tina
was the most popular girl in class. Going with
328/593
Tina was such powerful social currency, Park
was still spending it.
Being Tina’s first boyfriend kept Park out of
the lowest neighborhood caste. Even though they
all thought Park was weird and yellow, even
though he had never fit in … They couldn’t call
him a freak or a chink or a fag because – well
first, because his dad was a giant and a veteran
and from the neighborhood. But second, because
what would that say about Tina?
And Tina had never turned on Park or pretended
he didn’t happen. In fact … Well. There
were times when he thought she wanted
something to happen between them again.
Like, a few times, she’d come over to Park’s
house on the wrong day for her hair appointment
– and ended up in Park’s room, trying to find
something for them to talk about.
On homecoming night, when she came over
to have her hair put up, she’d stopped in Park’s
room to ask what he thought of her strapless blue
329/593
dress. She’d had him untangle her necklace from
the hair at the back of her neck.
Park always let these opportunities pass like
he didn’t see them.
Steve would kill him if he hooked up with
Tina.
Plus, Park didn’t want to hook up with Tina.
They didn’t have anything in common – like,
nothing – and it wasn’t the kind of nothing that
can be exotic and exciting. It was just boring.
He didn’t even think Tina really liked him,
deep down. It was more like she didn’t want him
to get over her. And not-so-deep down, Park
didn’t want Tina to get over him.
It was nice to have the most popular girl in
the neighborhood offering herself to him every
now and then.
Park rolled onto his stomach and pushed his
face into his pillow. He’d thought he was over
caring what people thought about him. He’d
thought that loving Eleanor proved that.
330/593
But he kept finding new pockets of shallow
inside himself. He kept finding new ways to betray
her.
331/593
CHAPTER 31
Eleanor
There was just one more day of school left before
Christmas vacation. Eleanor didn’t go. She told
her mother she was sick.
Park
When he got to the bus stop Friday morning,
Park was ready to apologize. But Eleanor didn’t
show up. Which made him feel a lot less like
apologizing …
‘What now?’ he said in the direction of her
house. Were they supposed to break up over this?
Was she going to go three weeks without talking
to him?
He knew it wasn’t Eleanor’s fault that she
didn’t have a phone, and that her house was the
Fortress of Solitude, but … Jesus. It made it so
easy for her to cut herself off whenever she felt
like it.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said at her house, too loudly.
A dog started barking in the yard next to him.
‘Sorry,’ Park muttered to the dog.
The bus turned the corner and heaved to a
stop. Park could see Tina in the back window,
watching him.
I’m sorry, he thought, not looking back again.
Eleanor
With Richie at work all day, she didn’t have to
stay in her room, but she did anyway. Like a dog
who won’t leave its kennel.
She ran out of batteries. She ran out of things
to read …
She lay in bed so much, she actually felt
dizzy when she got up Sunday afternoon to eat
333/593
dinner. (Her mom said Eleanor had to come out
of her crypt if she was hungry.) Eleanor sat on
the living room floor next to Mouse.
‘Why are you crying?’ he asked. He was
holding a bean burrito and it was dripping onto
his T-shirt and the floor.
‘I’m not,’ she said.
Mouse held the burrito over his head and
tried to catch the leak with his mouth. ‘Yeh oo
are.’
Maisie looked up at Eleanor, then back at the
TV.
‘Is it because you hate Dad?’ Mouse asked.
‘Yes,’ Eleanor said.
‘Eleanor,’ her mother said, walking out of the
kitchen.
‘No,’ Eleanor said to Mouse, shaking her
head. ‘I told you, I’m not crying.’ She went back
to her room and climbed into bed, rubbing her
face in the pillow.
Nobody followed her to see what was wrong.
334/593
Maybe her mom realized that she’d pretty
much forfeited the right to ask questions for all
eternity when she dumped Eleanor at somebody’s
house for a year.
Or maybe just she didn’t care.
Eleanor rolled onto her back and picked up
her dead Walkman. She took out the tape and
held it up to the light, turning the reels with her
fingertip and looking at Park’s handwriting on
the label.
‘Never mind the Sex Pistols … Songs Eleanor
might like.’
Park thought she’d written those awful things
on her books herself.
And he’d taken Tina’s side against hers.
Tina’s.
She closed her eyes again and remembered
the first time that he kissed her … How she’d let
her neck bend back, how she’d opened her
mouth. How she’d believed him when he said she
was special.
335/593
Park
A week into break, his dad asked Park if he and
Eleanor had broken up.
‘Sort of,’ Park said.
‘That’s too bad,’ his dad said.
‘It is?’
‘Well, it must be. You’re acting like a fouryear-
old lost at Kmart …
Park sighed.
‘Can’t you get her back?’ his dad asked
‘I can’t even get her to talk to me.’
‘It’s too bad you can’t talk to your mother
about this. The only way I know how to land a
girl is to look sharp in a uniform.’
Eleanor
A week into break, Eleanor’s mom woke her up
before sunrise. ‘Do you want to walk to the store
with me?’
‘No,’ Eleanor said.
‘Come on, I could use the extra hands.’
336/593
Her mom walked fast, and she had long legs.
Eleanor had to take extra steps just to keep up.
‘It’s cold,’ she said.
‘I told you to wear a hat.’ Her mom had told
her to wear socks, too, but they looked ridiculous
with Eleanor’s Vans.
It was a forty-minute walk.
When they got to the grocery store, her mom
bought them each a day-old cream horn and a
cup of twenty-five-cent coffee. Eleanor dumped
Coffee-Mate and Sweet’N Low in hers, and followed
her mom to the bargain bin. Her mom had
this thing about being the first person to go
through all the smashed cereal boxes and dented
cans …
Afterward, they walked to the Goodwill, and
Eleanor found a stack of old Analog magazines
and settled in on the least disgusting couch in the
furniture section.
When it was time to go, her mom came up
from behind her with an incredibly ugly stocking
cap and pulled it over her head.
337/593
‘Great,’ Eleanor said, ‘now I have lice.’
She felt better on the way home. (Which was
probably the point of this whole field trip.) It was
still cold, but the sun was shining, and her mom
was humming that Joni Mitchell song about
clouds and circuses.
Eleanor almost told her everything.
About Park and Tina and the bus and the
fight, about the place between his grandparents’
house and the RV.
She felt it all right at the back of her throat,
like a bomb – or a tiger – sitting on the base of
her tongue. Keeping it in made her eyes water.
The plastic shopping bags were cutting into
her palms. Eleanor shook her head and
swallowed.
Park
Park rode his bike by her house over and over
one day until her stepdad’s truck was gone and
338/593
one of the other kids came outside to play in the
snow.
It was the older boy, Park couldn’t remember
his name. The kid scuttled up the steps nervously
when Park stopped in front of the house.
‘Hey, wait,’ Park said, ‘please, hey … is your
sister home?’
‘Maisie?’
‘No, Eleanor …’
‘I’m not telling you,’ the boy said, running
into the house.
Park jerked his bike forward and pedaled
away.
339/593
CHAPTER 32
Eleanor
The box of pineapple arrived on Christmas Eve.
You’d have thought Santa Claus had shown up in
person with a bag of toys for each of them.
Maisie and Ben were already fighting over
the box. Maisie wanted it for her Barbies. Ben
didn’t have anything to put in it, but Eleanor still
hoped he’d win.
Ben had just turned twelve, and Richie said
he was too old to share a room with girls and babies.
Richie had brought home a mattress and put
it in the basement, and now Ben had to sleep
down there with the dog and Richie’s free
weights.
In their old house, Ben wouldn’t even go
down to the basement to put clothes in the wash –
and that basement had at least been dry and
mostly finished. Ben was scared of mice and bats
and spiders and anything that started moving
when the lights went out. Richie had already
yelled at him, twice, for trying to sleep at the top
of the stairs.
The pineapple came with a letter from their
uncle and his wife. Eleanor’s mom read it first,
and it made her get all teary. ‘Oh, Eleanor,’ she
said excitedly, ‘Geoff wants you to come up for
the summer. He says there’s a program at his university,
a camp for gifted high school students
…’
Before Eleanor could even think about what
that meant – St Paul, a camp where nobody knew
her, where nobody was Park – Richie was shooting
it down.
‘You can’t send her up to Minnesota by
herself.’
‘My brother’s there.’
‘What does he know about teenage girls?’
‘You know I lived with him in high school.’
341/593
‘Yeah, and he let you get pregnant …’
Ben was lying solidly on top of the pineapple
box, and Maisie was kicking him in the back.
They were both shouting.
‘It’s just a fucking box,’ Richie yelled. ‘If I
knew that you wanted boxes for Christmas, I
would have saved myself some money.’
That silenced everyone. Nobody had expected
Richie to buy Christmas presents. ‘I should
make you wait until Christmas morning,’ he said,
‘but I’m sick of watching this.’
He put his cigarette in his mouth and put his
boots on. They heard the truck door open, and
then Richie was back with a big ShopKo bag. He
started throwing boxes onto the floor.
‘Mouse,’ he said. A remote-control monster
truck.
‘Ben.’ A big racetrack.
‘Maisie … cause you like to sing.’ Richie
pulled out a keyboard, an actual electronic keyboard.
It was probably some off-brand, but still.
342/593
He didn’t drop it on the floor. He handed it to
Maisie.
‘And Little Richie … where’s Little Richie?’
‘He’s taking a nap,’ their mom said.
Richie shrugged and threw a teddy bear onto
the floor. The bag was empty, and Eleanor felt
cold with relief.
Then Richie took out his wallet and pulled
out a bill.
‘Here, Eleanor, come get it. Buy yourself
some normal clothes.’
She looked at her mother, standing blankfaced
in the kitchen doorway, then walked over
to take the money. It was a fifty.
‘Thank you.’ Eleanor said it as flatly as possible.
Then she went to sit on the couch. The little
kids were all opening their presents.
‘Thanks, Dad,’ Mouse kept saying. ‘Oh man,
thanks, Dad!’
‘Yeah,’ Richie said, ‘you’re welcome. You’re
welcome. That’s a real Christmas.’
343/593
Richie stayed home all day to watch the little
kids play with their toys. Maybe the Broken Rail
wasn’t open on Christmas Eve. Eleanor went to
her bedroom to get away from him. (And to get
away from Maisie’s new keyboard.)
She was tired of missing Park. She just
wanted to see him. Even if he did think she was a
perverted psychopath who wrote herself badly
punctuated threats. Even if he had spent his
formative years tongue-kissing Tina. None of it
was vile enough to make Eleanor stop wanting
him. (How vile would that have to be? she
wondered.)
Maybe she should just go over to his house
right now and pretend that nothing had happened.
Maybe she would, if it wasn’t Christmas Eve.
Why didn’t Jesus ever work with her?
Later, her mom came in to say they were going to
the store to buy groceries for Christmas dinner.
‘I’ll come out and watch the kids,’ Eleanor
said.
344/593
‘Richie wants us all to go,’ her mom said,
smiling, ‘as a family.’
‘But, Mom …’
‘None of this, Eleanor,’ she said softly,
‘we’re having a good day.’
‘Mom, come on – he’s been drinking all day.’
Her mom shook her head. ‘Richie’s fine, he
never has a problem with driving.’
‘I don’t think the fact that he drinks and
drives all the time is a very good argument.’
‘You just can’t stand this, can you?’ her mom
said quietly, angrily, stepping into the room and
shutting the door behind her.
‘Look,’ she said, ‘I know that you’re going
through …’ She looked at Eleanor, then shook
her head again. ‘Something. But everyone else in
this house is having a great day. Everyone else in
this house deserves a great day.
‘We’re a family, Eleanor. All of us. Richie,
too. And I’m sorry that makes you so unhappy.
I’m sorry that things aren’t perfect here all the
time for you … But this is our life now. You
345/593
can’t keep throwing tantrums about it, you can’t
keep trying to undermine this family – I won’t let
you.’
Eleanor clenched her jaw.
‘I have to think of everyone,’ her mom said.
‘Do you understand? I have to think of myself. In
a few years, you’ll be on your own, but Richie is
my husband.’
She almost sounded sane, Eleanor thought. If
you didn’t know that she was acting rational on
the far side of crazy.
‘Get up,’ her mother said, ‘and put on your
coat.’
Eleanor put on her coat and her new hat and
followed her brothers and sisters into the back of
the Isuzu.
When they got to Food 4 Less, Richie waited
in the truck while everybody else went in. As
soon as they were inside, Eleanor put the
wadded-up fifty in her mother’s hand.
Her mother didn’t thank her.
346/593
Park
They were shopping for Christmas dinner, and it
was taking forever because it always made Park’s
mom nervous to cook for his grandmother.
‘What kind of stuffing Grandma like?’ his
mom asked.
‘Pepperidge Farm,’ Park said, standing on the
back of the cart and popping a wheelie.
‘Pepperidge Farm original? Or Pepperidge
Farm cornbread?’
‘I don’t know, original.’
‘If you don’t know, don’t tell me … Look,’
she said, looking over his shoulder. ‘There’s your
Eleanor.’
El-la-no.
Park whipped around and saw Eleanor standing
by the meat case with all four of her redheaded
brothers and sisters. (Except none of them
had red hair standing next to Eleanor. Nobody
did.)
A woman walked up to the cart and set down
a turkey.
347/593
That must be Eleanor’s mom, Park thought,
she looked just like her. But sharper and with
more shadows. Like Eleanor, but taller. Like
Eleanor, but tired. Like Eleanor, after the fall.
Park’s mom was staring at them, too.
‘Mom, come on,’ Park whispered.
‘Aren’t you going to say hi?’ she asked.
Park shook his head, but didn’t turn away. He
didn’t think Eleanor would want him to, and even
if she did, he didn’t want to get her in trouble.
What if her stepdad was here, too?
Eleanor looked different, drabber than usual.
There was nothing hanging from her hair or
magpie-tied to her wrists …
She still looked beautiful. His eyes missed
her as much as the rest of him. He wanted to run
to her and tell her – tell her how sorry he was and
how much he needed her.
She didn’t see him.
‘Mom,’ he whispered again, ‘come on.’
Park thought his mom might say something more
about it in the car, but she was quiet. When they
348/593
got home, she said she was tired. She asked Park
to bring in the groceries, then she spent the rest
of the afternoon in her room with the door closed.
His dad went in to check on her at dinner
time, and an hour later, when they both came out,
his dad said they were going to Pizza Hut for dinner.
‘On Christmas Eve?’ Josh said. They always
had waffles and watched movies on Christmas
Eve. They’d already rented Billy Jack. ‘Get in the
car,’ his dad said. Park’s mom’s eyes were red,
and she didn’t bother reapplying her eye makeup
before they left.
When they got home, Park went straight to
his room. He just wanted to be alone to think
about seeing Eleanor – but his mom came in a
few minutes later. She sat on his bed without
making a single wave.
She held out a Christmas present. ‘This … is
for your Eleanor,’ she said. ‘From me.’
Park looked at the gift. He took it, but shook
his head.
349/593
‘I don’t know if I’ll have a chance to give it
to her.’
‘Your Eleanor,’ she said, ‘she come from big
family.’
Park shook the present gently.
‘I come from big family,’ his mom said.
‘Three little sisters. Three little brothers.’ She
held out her hand, as if she were patting six
heads.
She’d had a wine cooler with dinner, and you
could tell. She almost never talked about Korea.
‘What were their names?’ Park asked.
His mom’s hand settled gently in her lap.
‘In big family,’ she said, ‘everything …
everybody spread so thin. Thin like paper, you
know?’ She made a tearing gesture. ‘You know?’
Maybe two wine coolers.
‘I’m not sure,’ Park said.
‘Nobody gets enough,’ she said. ‘Nobody
gets what they need. When you always hungry,
you get hungry in your head.’ She tapped her
forehead. ‘You know?’
350/593
Park wasn’t sure what to say.
‘You don’t know,’ she said, shaking her head.
‘I don’t want you to know … I’m sorry.’
‘Don’t be sorry,’ he said.
‘I’m sorry for how I welcomed your Eleanor.’
‘Mom, it’s okay. This isn’t your fault.’
‘I don’t think I say this right …’
‘It’s okay, Mindy,’ Park’s dad said softly
from the doorway. ‘Come to bed, honey.’ He
walked over to the bed and helped Park’s mom
up, then stood with his arm wrapped protectively
around her. ‘Your mom just wants you to be
happy,’ he said to Park. ‘Don’t puss out on our
account.’
His mother frowned, like she wasn’t sure
whether that counted as a dirty word.
Park waited until the TV was off in his parents’
room. Then he waited a half-hour after that. Then
he grabbed his coat and slipped out the back
door, on the far side of the house.
He ran until he got to the end of the alley.
Eleanor was so close.
351/593
Her stepdad’s truck was in the driveway.
Maybe that was good; Park wouldn’t want him
coming home while Park was standing there on
the front porch. All the lights were off, as far as
Park could tell, and there was no sign of the dog
…
He climbed the steps as quietly as possible.
He knew which room was Eleanor’s. She’d
told him once that she slept by the window, and
he knew she had the top bunk. He stood to the
side of the window, so he wouldn’t cast a shadow.
He was going to tap softly, and if anyone but
Eleanor looked out, he was going to run for his
life.
Park tapped the top of the glass. Nothing
happened. The curtain, or the sheet or whatever it
was, didn’t move.
She was probably sleeping. He tapped a little
harder and got ready to run. The side of the sheet
opened just a sliver, but he couldn’t see in.
Should he run? Should he hide?
352/593
He stepped in front of the window. The sheet
opened wider. He could see Eleanor’s face, she
looked terrified.
‘Go,’ she mouthed.
He shook his head.
‘Go,’ she mouthed again. Then she pointed
away. ‘School,’ she said. At least that’s what he
thought she said. Park ran away.
Eleanor
All Eleanor could think was that if somebody
were breaking in through this window, how was
she supposed to escape and call 911?
Not that the police would even come after last
time. But at least she could wake that bastard Gil
up and eat his goddamn brownies.
Park was the last person she expected to see
standing there.
Her heart leapt out to him before she could
stop it. He was going to get them both killed.
Shots had been fired for less.
353/593
As soon as he disappeared from the window,
she slipped off the bed like that stupid cat and put
her bra and shoes on in the dark. She was wearing
a great big T-shirt and a pair of her dad’s old
flannel pajama pants. Her coat was in the living
room, so she put on a sweater.
Maisie had fallen asleep watching TV, so it
was relatively easy to climb over her empty bed
and out the window.
He’ll kick me out for real this time, Eleanor
thought, tiptoeing across the porch. That would
be his best Christmas ever.
Park was waiting on the school steps. Where
they’d sat and read Watchmen. As soon as he saw
her, he stood up and ran to her. Like, actually
ran.
He ran to her – and took her face in both of
his hands. And then he was kissing her before she
could say no. And she was kissing him back before
she could remind herself that she wasn’t ever
going to kiss anybody again, especially not him,
because look how miserable it had made her.
354/593
She was crying, and so was Park. When she
put her hands on his cheeks, they were wet.
And warm. He was so warm.
She bent her neck back and kissed him like
she never had before. Like she wasn’t scared of
doing it wrong.
He pulled away to say he was sorry, and she
shook her head no, because even though she
really did want him to be sorry, she wanted to
kiss him more.
‘I’m sorry, Eleanor.’ He held her face against
his. ‘I was wrong about everything. Everything.’
‘I’m sorry, too,’ she said.
‘For what?’
‘For acting mad at you all the time.’
‘It’s okay,’ he said, ‘sometimes I like it.’
‘But not always.’
He shook his head.
‘I don’t even know why I do it,’ she said.
‘It doesn’t matter.’
‘I’m not sorry about getting mad about Tina.’
355/593
He pressed his forehead against hers until it
hurt. ‘Don’t even say her name,’ he said. ‘She’s
nothing and you’re … everything. You’re
everything, Eleanor.’
He kissed her again, and she opened her
mouth.
They stayed outside until Park couldn’t rub any
warmth back into her hands. Until her lips were
numb from cold and kissing.
He wanted to walk her back home, but she
told him that would be suicidal.
‘Come see me tomorrow,’ he said.
‘I can’t, it’s Christmas.’
‘The next day, then.’
‘The next day,’ she said.
‘And the day after that.’
She laughed. ‘I don’t think your mom would
like that. I don’t think she likes me.’
‘You’re wrong,’ he said. ‘Come.’
Eleanor was climbing the front steps when
she heard him whispering her name. She turned
back, but she couldn’t see him in the shadows.
356/593
‘Merry Christmas,’ he said.
She smiled, but didn’t answer.
357/593
CHAPTER 33
Eleanor
Eleanor slept until noon on Christmas Day. Until
her mom finally came in and told her to wake up.
‘Are you okay?’ her mom asked.
‘I’m asleep.’
‘You look like you’re getting a cold.’
‘Does that mean I can go back to sleep?’
‘I guess so. Look, Eleanor …’ her mother
stepped away from the door, and her voice
dropped. ‘I’m going to talk to Richie about this
summer. I think I can get him to change his mind
about that camp.’
Eleanor opened her eyes. ‘No. No, I don’t
want to go.’
‘But I thought you’d jump at the chance to
get out of here.’
‘No,’ Eleanor said, ‘I don’t want to have to
leave everybody … again.’ Saying it made her
feel like one hundred percent jerk, but she’d say
anything to spend the summer with Park. (And
she wasn’t even going to tell herself that he’d
probably be sick of her by then.) ‘I want to stay
home,’ she said.
Her mom nodded. ‘Okay,’ she said, ‘then I
won’t mention it. But if you change your mind
…’
‘I won’t,’ Eleanor said.
Her mom left the room, and Eleanor pretended
to go back to sleep.
Park
He slept until noon on Christmas Day, until Josh
came in and sprayed him with one of their mom’s
salon water bottles.
‘Dad says that if you don’t get up, he’s going
to let me have all your presents.’
Park beat Josh back with a pillow.
359/593
Everybody else was waiting for him, and the
whole house smelled like turkey. His grandma
wanted him to open her present first – a new
‘Kiss Me, I’m Irish’ T-shirt. A size bigger than
last year’s, which meant it would be a size too
big.
His parents gave him a fifty-dollar gift certificate
to Drastic Plastic, the punk-rock record
store downtown. (Park was surprised that they’d
think of that. And he was surprised that DP sold
gift certificates. Not very punk.)
He also got two black sweaters he might actually
wear, some Avon cologne in a bottle shaped
like an electric guitar, and an empty key ring –
which his dad made sure everybody noticed.
Park’s sixteenth birthday had come and gone,
and he didn’t even care anymore about getting
his license and driving himself to school. He
wasn’t going to give up his only guaranteed time
with Eleanor.
360/593
She’d already told him that as awesome as
last night was – and they both agreed it was awesome
– she couldn’t risk sneaking out again.
‘Any one of my siblings could have woken
up, they still could, and they would definitely tell
on me. They have very confused allegiances.’
‘But if you’re quiet …’
That’s when she’d told him that, most nights,
she shared a room with all of her brothers and
sisters. All of them. A room about the size of his,
she said, ‘minus the waterbed.’
They were sitting against the back door of the
school, in a little alcove where no one would see
them unless they were really looking, and where
the snow didn’t fall directly on their faces. They
sat next to each other, facing each other, holding
hands.
There was nothing between them now. Nothing
stupid and selfish just taking up space.
‘So you have two brothers and two sisters?’
‘Three brothers, one sister.’
‘What are their names?’
361/593
‘Why?’
‘I’m just curious,’ he said. ‘Is it classified?’
She sighed. ‘Ben, Maisie …’
‘Maisie?’
‘Yeah. Then Mouse – Jeremiah. He’s five.
Then the baby. Little Richie.’
Park laughed. ‘You call him “Little Richie”?’
‘Well, his dad is Big Richie, not that he’s
very big either …’
‘I know, but like Little Richard? “Tutti-
Frutti”?’
‘Oh my God, I never thought of that. Why
haven’t I ever thought of that?’
He pulled her hands to his chest. He still
hadn’t managed to touch Eleanor anywhere below
the chin or above the elbow. He didn’t think
she’d necessarily stop him if he tried, but what if
she did? That’d be awful. Anyway, her hands and
her face were excellent.
‘Do you guys get along?’
‘Sometimes … They’re all crazy.’
‘How can a five-year-old be crazy?’
362/593
‘Oh my God, Mouse? He’s the craziest of
them all. He’s always got a hammer or a jackrabbit
or something stuck in his back pocket, and he
refuses to wear a shirt.’
Park laughed. ‘How is Maisie crazy?’
‘Well, she’s mean. For starters. And she
fights like a street person. Like, take-off-yourearrings
fights.’
‘How old is she?’
‘Eight. No, nine.’
‘What about Ben?’
‘Ben …’ She looked away. ‘You’ve seen
Ben. He’s almost Josh’s age. He needs a haircut.’
‘Does Richie hate them, too?’
Eleanor pushed Park’s hands forward. ‘Why
do you want to talk about this?’
He pushed back. ‘Because. It’s your life. Because
I’m interested. It’s like you’ve got all these
weird barriers set up, like you only want me to
have access to this tiny part of you …’
‘Yes,’ she said, crossing her arms. ‘Barriers.
Caution tape. I’m doing you a favor.’
363/593
‘Don’t,’ he said. ‘I can handle it.’ He put his
thumb between her eyebrows and tried to smooth
out the frown. ‘This whole stupid fight was about
keeping secrets.’
‘Keeping secrets about your demonic ex-girlfriend.
I don’t have any demonic ex-anythings.’
‘Does Richie hate your brothers and sister,
too?’
‘Stop saying his name.’ She was whispering.
‘I’m sorry.’ Park whispered back.
‘He hates everybody, I think.’
‘Not your mom.’
‘Especially her.’
‘Is he mean to her?’
Eleanor rolled her eyes and wiped her cheek
with her sweater sleeve. ‘Uh. Yeah.’
Park took her hands again. ‘Why doesn’t she
leave?’
She shook her head. ‘I don’t think she can …
I don’t think there’s enough of her left.’
‘Is she scared of him?’ he asked.
‘Yeah …’
364/593
‘Are you scared of him?’
‘Me?’
‘I know you’re scared of getting kicked out,
but are you scared of him?’
‘No.’ She lifted up her chin. ‘No … I just
have to lay low, you know? Like as long as I stay
out of his way, I’m fine. I just have to be
invisible.’
Park smiled.
‘What?’ she asked.
‘You. Invisible.’
She smiled. He let go of her hands and held
her face. Her cheeks were cold, and her eyes
were fathomless in the dark.
She was all he could see.
Eventually it was too cold to stay out there. Even
the insides of their mouths were freezing.
Eleanor
Richie said Eleanor had to come out of her room
for Christmas dinner. Fine. She really was getting
365/593
a cold, so at least it didn’t seem like she’d been
faking it all day.
Dinner was awesome. Her mom could really
cook when she had actual food to work with. (Something
other than legumes.)
They had turkey with stuffing, and mashed
potatoes swimming with dill and butter. For
dessert there was rice pudding and pepper cookies,
which her mom only ever made on
Christmas.
At least that had been the rule back when her
mom used to make all kinds of cookies, all year
long. The little kids didn’t know what they were
missing now. When Eleanor and Ben were little,
their mom baked constantly. There were always
fresh cookies in the kitchen when Eleanor got
home from school. And real breakfast every
morning … Eggs and bacon, or pancakes and
sausage, or oatmeal with cream and brown sugar.
Eleanor used to think that that was why she
was so fat. But look at her now, she was starving
all the time, and she was still enormous.
366/593
They all tore into Christmas dinner like it was
their last meal, which it practically was, at least
for a while. Ben ate both of the turkey legs, and
Mouse ate an entire plate of mashed potatoes.
Richie had been drinking all day again, so he
was all kinds of festive at dinner – laughing too
much and too loud. But you couldn’t enjoy the
fact that he was in a good mood, because it was
the kind of good mood that was just on the edge
of a bad one. They were all waiting for him to
cross over …
Which he did, as soon as he realized there
was no pumpkin pie.
‘What the fuck is this?’ he said, flicking his
spoon in the ris ala mande.
‘It’s rice pudding,’ Ben said, stupid with
turkey.
‘I know it’s pudding,’ Richie said. ‘Where’s
the pumpkin pie, Sabrina?’ he shouted into the
kitchen. ‘I told you to make a real Christmas dinner.
I gave you money for a real Christmas
dinner.’
367/593
Her mother stood in the doorway to the kitchen.
She still hadn’t sat down to eat. ‘It’s …’
It’s a traditional Danish Christmas dessert,
Eleanor thought. My grandmother made it, and
her grandmother made it, and it’s better than
pumpkin pie. It’s special.
‘It’s … just that I forgot to buy pumpkin,’ her
mother said.
‘How could you forget the fucking pumpkin
on Christmas,’ Richie said, hurling the stainlesssteel
bowl of rice pudding. It hit the wall near her
mother and sprayed weepy chunks everywhere.
Everyone but Richie stayed still.
He stood up unsteadily from his chair. ‘I’m
going to go buy some pumpkin pie … so this
family can have a real fucking Christmas dinner.’
He walked to the back door.
As soon as they heard his truck tear out,
Eleanor’s mom picked up the bowl with what
was left of the rice pudding, then skimmed the
top off the pile of pudding on the floor.
‘Who wants cherry sauce?’ she said.
368/593
They all did.
Eleanor cleaned up the rest of the pudding,
and Ben turned on the TV. They watched The
Grinch and Frosty the Snowman, and A Christmas
Carol.
Their mom even sat down to watch with
them.
Eleanor couldn’t help but think that if the
Ghost of Christmas Past showed up, he’d be disgusted
with their whole situation. But Eleanor
felt full and happy when she fell asleep.
369/593
CHAPTER 34
Eleanor
Park’s mom didn’t seem surprised to see Eleanor
the next day. He must have warned them she was
coming.
‘Eleanor,’ his mom said extra nicely, ‘Merry
Christmas, come in.’
When Eleanor walked into the living room,
Park had just gotten out of the shower, which was
embarrassing for some reason. His hair was wet
and his T-shirt was kind of sticking to him. He
was really happy to see her. That was obvious.
(And nice.)
She didn’t know what to do with his present,
so when he walked over to her, she shoved it at
him. He smiled, surprised. ‘This is for me?’
‘No,’ she said, ‘it’s …’ She couldn’t think of
anything funny to say. ‘Yeah, it’s for you.’
‘You didn’t have to get me anything.’
‘I didn’t. Really.’
‘Can I open it?’
She still couldn’t think of anything funny, so
she nodded. At least his family was in the kitchen,
so nobody was watching them.
The present was wrapped in stationery.
Eleanor’s favorite stationery, watercolor paintings
of fairies and flowers.
Park peeled off the paper carefully and
looked at the book. It was The Catcher in the
Rye. A really old edition. Eleanor had decided to
leave the dust jacket on because it was neat-looking,
even though it still had a thrift-shop price
scrawled on the front with grease pencil.
‘I know it’s pretentious,’ she said. ‘I was going
to give you Watership Down, but that’s about
rabbits, and not everybody wants to read about
rabbits …’
371/593
He looked at the book, smiling. For a terrible
second, she thought he was going to open the
front cover. And she really didn’t want him to
read what she’d written. (Not while she was
standing right there.)
‘Is this your book?’ he asked.
‘Yeah, but I’ve already read it.’
‘Thank you,’ he said, grinning at her. When
he was really happy, his eyes disappeared into his
cheeks. ‘Thank you.’
‘You’re welcome,’ she said, looking down.
‘Just don’t kill John Lennon or anything.’
‘Come here,’ he said, pulling on the front of
her jacket.
She followed him to his room but stopped at
the door like there was an invisible fence. Park
set the book on his bed, then grabbed two small
boxes off a shelf. They were both wrapped in
Christmas paper with big red bows.
He came and stood in the doorway with her;
she leaned back against the jamb.
372/593
‘This one is from my mom,’ he said, holding
up a box. ‘It’s perfume. Please don’t wear it.’ His
eyes flicked down for a second, then back up at
her. ‘This one is from me.’
‘You didn’t have to get me a present,’ she
said.
‘Don’t be stupid.’
When she didn’t take the present, he took her
hand and pressed the box into it.
‘I tried to think of something that nobody
would notice but you,’ he said, pushing his bangs
off his face. ‘That you wouldn’t have to explain
to your mom … Like, I was going to buy you a
really nice pen, but then …’
He was watching her open it, which made her
nervous. She accidentally tore the wrapping paper.
He took the paper from her, and she opened
a small gray box.
There was a necklace inside. A thin silver
chain with a small pendant, a silver pansy.
‘I’ll understand if you can’t take it,’ Park
said.
373/593
She shouldn’t take it, but she wanted it.
Park
Dumb. He should have gotten the pen. Jewelry
was so public … and personal, which is why he’d
bought it. He couldn’t buy Eleanor a pen. Or a
bookmark. He didn’t have bookmark-like feelings
for her.
Park had used most of his car stereo money to
buy the necklace. He’d found it at the jewelry
store in the mall where people try on engagement
rings.
‘I kept the receipt,’ he said.
‘No,’ Eleanor said, looking up at him. She
looked anxious, but he wasn’t sure what kind.
‘No. It’s beautiful,’ she said, ‘thank you.’
‘Will you wear it?’ he asked.
She nodded.
He ran his hand through his hair and held
onto the back of his neck, trying to rein himself
in. ‘Now?’
374/593
Eleanor looked at him for a second, then nodded
again. He took the necklace out of the box
and carefully fastened it around her neck. Just
like he’d imagined himself doing when he bought
it. That might even be why he bought it – so he’d
have this moment, with his hands warm on the
back of her neck, under her hair. He ran his fingertips
along the chain and settled the pendant on
her throat.
She shivered.
Park wanted to pull on the chain, to pull it into
his chest and anchor her there.
He pulled his hands away self-consciously
and leaned back against the doorjamb.
Eleanor
They were sitting in the kitchen, playing cards.
Speed. She’d taught Park how to play, and she
could always beat him for the first few rounds.
But after that, she’d get sloppy. (Maisie always
started winning after a few rounds, too.)
375/593
Playing cards in Park’s kitchen, even if his
mom was in there, was better than just sitting in
the living room, thinking about all the things
they’d be doing if they were alone.
His mom asked how her Christmas was, and
Eleanor said it was nice. ‘What do you have for
holiday dinner?’ his mom asked. ‘Turkey or
ham?’
‘Turkey,’ Eleanor said, ‘with dill potatoes …
My mom’s Danish.’
Park stopped playing to look at her. She
popped her eyes at him. ‘What, I’m Danish, shut
up,’ she would have said if his mom hadn’t been
there.
‘That’s where you get beautiful red hair,’ his
mom said knowingly.
Park smiled at Eleanor. She rolled her eyes.
When his mom left to run something over to
his grandparents, Park kicked her under the table.
He wasn’t wearing shoes.
‘I didn’t know you were Danish,’ he said.
376/593
‘Is this the kind of scintillating conversation
we’re going to have now that we don’t have any
secrets?’
‘Yes. Is your mom Danish?’
‘Yes,’ she said.
‘What’s your dad?’
‘An ass.’
He frowned.
‘What? You wanted honest and intimate.
That’s way more honest than “Scottish.”’
‘Scottish,’ Park said, and smiled.
Eleanor had been thinking about this new arrangement
he wanted. This being totally open
and honest with each other. She didn’t think she
could start telling Park the whole, ugly truth
overnight.
What if he was wrong? What if he couldn’t
handle it?
What if Park realized that all the things he
thought were so mysterious and intriguing about
her were actually just … bleak?
377/593
When he asked about her Christmas, Eleanor
told him about her mom’s cookies and the
movies, and how Mouse thought The Grinch was
about ‘all the Hoots down in Hootville.’
She half expected him to say, ‘Yeah, but now
tell me all the terrible parts …’ Instead he
laughed.
‘Do you think your mom would be okay with
me,’ he asked, ‘you know, if it wasn’t for your
stepdad?’
‘I don’t know …’ Eleanor said. She realized
that she was holding on to the silver pansy.
Eleanor spent the rest of Christmas vacation at
Park’s house. His mom didn’t seem to mind, and
his dad was always inviting her to stay for dinner.
Eleanor’s mom thought she was spending all
that time with Tina. Once she’d said, ‘I hope
you’re not overstaying your welcome over there,
Eleanor.’ And once she’d said, ‘Tina could come
over here sometimes, too, you know,’ which they
both knew was a joke.
378/593
Nobody brought friends into their house. Not
the little kids. Not even Richie. And her mom
didn’t have friends anymore.
She used to.
When Eleanor’s parents were still together,
there were always people around. There were always
parties. Men with long hair. Women in long
dresses. Glasses of red wine everywhere.
And even after her dad left, there were still
women. Single moms who brought over their
kids, plus all the ingredients for banana daiquiris.
They’d sit up late talking in hushed voices about
their ex-husbands and speculating about new
boyfriends, while the kids played Trouble and
Sorry in the next room.
Richie had started as one of those stories. It
went like this:
Her mom used to walk to the grocery store
early in the morning while the kids were still
asleep. They didn’t have a car back then either.
(Her mom hadn’t had a car of her own since high
school.) Well, Richie would see her mom out
379/593
walking every morning on his drive to work. One
day he stopped and asked for her number. He
said she was the prettiest woman he’d ever seen.
When Eleanor first heard about Richie, she
was leaning against their old couch, reading a
Life magazine, and drinking a virgin banana daiquiri.
She wasn’t exactly eavesdropping – all her
mom’s friends liked having Eleanor around.
They liked that she watched their kids without
complaining, they said she was wise beyond her
years. If Eleanor was quiet, they sort of forgot
she was in the room. And if they drank too much,
they didn’t care.
‘Never trust a man, Eleanor!’ they’d all
shouted at her, at one point or another.
‘Especially if he hates to dance!’
But when her mom told them that Richie said
she was as pretty as a spring day, they’d all
sighed and asked her to tell them more.
Of course he said she’s the prettiest woman
he’s ever seen, Eleanor thought. She undoubtedly
is.
380/593
Eleanor was twelve, and she couldn’t imagine
a guy fucking her mom over worse than her dad
had.
She didn’t know there were things worse than
selfish.
Anyway. She always tried to leave Park’s house
before dinner – just in case her mom was right
about wearing out her welcome – and because, if
Eleanor left early, there was a better chance that
she’d beat Richie home.
Hanging out with Park every day had really
messed up her bath-taking routine. (A fact she
was never ever going to tell him, no matter how
sharey-carey they got.)
The only safe time to take a bath in her house
was right after school. If Eleanor went over to
Park’s house right after school, she had to hope
that Richie would still be at the Broken Rail
when she got home that night. And then she had
to take a really fast bath because the back door
was right across from the bathroom, and it could
open at any time.
381/593
She could tell that all this sneaky bath-taking
was making her mom nervous, but it wasn’t exactly
Eleanor’s fault. She’d considered taking a
shower in the locker room at school, but that
might even be more dangerous: Tina et al.
The other day at lunch, Tina had a made big
point of walking by Eleanor’s table and mouthing
the C-word. The c-u-n-t word. (Richie didn’t
even use that word, which implied an unimaginable
degree of filth.)
‘What is her problem?’ DeNice asked.
Rhetorically.
‘She thinks she’s all that,’ Beebi said.
‘She ain’t all that,’ DeNice said. ‘Walking
around here looking like a little boy in a
miniskirt.’
Beebi giggled.
‘That hair is just wrong,’ DeNice said, still
looking at Tina. ‘She needs to wake up a little
earlier and try to decide whether she wants to
look like Farrah Fawcett or Rick James.’
Beebi and Eleanor both cracked up.
382/593
‘I mean, pick one, girl,’ DeNice said, milking
it. ‘Pick. One.’
‘Oh, girl!’ Beebi said, slapping Eleanor’s leg.
‘There’s your man.’ They all looked out the
cafeteria’s glass wall. Park was walking by with
a few other guys. He was wearing jeans and a Tshirt
that said ‘Minor Threat.’ He looked into the
cafeteria and smiled when he saw Eleanor. Beebi
giggled.
‘He is cute,’ DeNice said. Like it was
something certifiable.
‘I know,’ Eleanor said. ‘I want to eat his
face.’
They all three giggled until DeNice called
them back to order.
Park
‘So,’ Cal said.
Park was still smiling. Even though they were
long past the cafeteria.
‘You and Eleanor, huh?’
383/593
‘Uh … yeah,’ Park said.
‘Yeah,’ Cal said, nodding. ‘Everybody
knows. I mean, I’ve known forever. I could tell
by the way you stare at her in English … I was
just waiting for you to tell me.’
‘Oh,’ Park said, looking up at Cal. ‘Sorry.
I’m going out with Eleanor.’
‘Why didn’t you tell me?’
‘I figured you knew.’
‘I did know,’ Cal said. ‘But, you know, we’re
friends. We’re supposed to talk about these
things.’
‘I didn’t think you’d get it …’
‘I don’t get it. No offense. Eleanor still scares
the crap out of me. But if you’re getting it – you
know, getting it – I want to know about it. I want
the whole freaking report.’
‘This, actually,’ Park said. ‘This is why I
didn’t tell you.’
384/593
CHAPTER 35
Eleanor
Park’s mom asked him to set the table. That was
Eleanor’s cue to leave. The sun had almost set.
She rushed down the steps before Park could stop
her … and almost ran into his dad standing in the
driveway.
‘Hey, Eleanor,’ he said, startling her. He was
messing around with something in the back of his
truck.
‘Hey,’ she said, rushing past him. He really
did look an awful lot like Magnum P.I. It wasn’t
something you got used to.
‘Hey, wait, come here,’ he said.
She felt something go slightly wrong in her
stomach. She stopped and stepped toward him,
but only a little.
‘Look,’ he said, ‘I’m getting tired of asking
you to stay for dinner.’
‘Okay …’ she said.
‘What I mean is, I want you to feel like you
have a standing invitation. You’re just … welcome,
okay?’ He seemed uncomfortable, and it
was making her uncomfortable. Way more uncomfortable
than she usually felt around him.
‘Okay …’ she said.
‘Look, Eleanor … I know your stepdad.’
This could go a million different ways, she
thought. All of them awful.
Park’s dad kept talking, one hand on his
truck, the other on the back of his neck, like he
was in pain. ‘We grew up together. I’m older
than Richie, but this is a small neighborhood, and
I’ve put in my time at the Rail …’
The sun was too far gone to see his face.
Eleanor still wasn’t sure what he was getting at.
‘I know that your stepdad isn’t an easy man
to be around,’ Park’s dad said finally, stepping
toward her. ‘And I’m just saying, you know, that
386/593
if it’s easier to be over here, then you should just
be here. That would make Mindy and I feel a lot
better, okay?’
‘Okay,’ she said.
‘So this is the last time I’m going to ask you
to stay for dinner.’
Eleanor smiled, and he smiled back, and for a
second he looked a lot more like Park than Tom
Selleck.
Park
Eleanor on the couch, holding his hand. Across
from him at the kitchen table with her homework
…
Helping him carry in groceries for his grandmother.
Politely eating everything his mom made
for dinner, even if it was something completely
disgusting like liver and onions …
They were always together, and it still wasn’t
enough.
387/593
He still hadn’t found a way to put his arms all
the way around her. And he still didn’t have
enough opportunities to kiss her. She wouldn’t go
to his room with him …
‘We can listen to music,’ he’d say.
‘Your mom …’
‘Doesn’t care. We’ll leave the door open.’
‘Where will we sit?’
‘On my bed.’
‘God. No.’
‘On the floor.’
‘I don’t want her to think I’m slutty.’
He wasn’t sure his mother even thought of
Eleanor as a girl.
She liked Eleanor though. More than she used
to. Just the other day, his mom had said that
Eleanor had excellent manners.
‘She’s very quiet,’ his mom said, like that
was a good thing.
‘She’s just nervous,’ Park said.
‘Why nervous?’
‘I don’t know,’ Park said. ‘She just is.’
388/593
He could tell that his mom still hated Eleanor’s
clothes. She was always looking her up and
down and shaking her head when she thought
Eleanor wasn’t looking.
Eleanor was unfailingly polite with his mom.
She even tried to make small talk. One Saturday
night after dinner, Park’s mom was sorting her
Avon shipment on the dining room table while
Park and Eleanor played cards. ‘How long have
you been a beautician?’ Eleanor asked, looking
over at all the bottles.
His mom loved that word.
‘Since Josh start school. I get my GED, I go
to beauty school, get license, get permit …’
‘Wow,’ Eleanor said.
‘I always do hair,’ his mom said, ‘even before.’
She opened a pink bottle of lotion and
smelled it. ‘Little girl … cut doll’s hair, paint on
makeup.’
‘That sounds like my sister,’ Eleanor said. ‘I
could never do any of that.’
389/593
‘Not so hard …’ his mom said, looking up at
her. His mom’s eyes lit up. ‘Hey, I have good
idea,’ she said. ‘I do your hair. We have
makeover night.’
Eleanor’s mouth dropped open. She was
probably picturing herself with feathered hair and
fake eyelashes.
‘Oh, no …’ she said. ‘I couldn’t …’
‘Yes,’ his mom said, ‘so much fun!’
‘Mom, no,’ Park said, ‘Eleanor doesn’t want
a makeover … She doesn’t need a makeover,’ he
added, as soon as he thought of it.
‘Not big makeover,’ his mom said. She was
already reaching for Eleanor’s hair. ‘No cutting.
Nothing we can’t wash off.’
Park looked at Eleanor, pleading. Hopefully,
she’d know that he was pleading because it
would make his mom happy, not because he
thought there was anything wrong with her.
‘No cutting?’ Eleanor said.
His mom was fingering a curl. ‘Better light in
the garage,’ she said, ‘come on.’
390/593
Eleanor
Park’s mom put Eleanor in the shampoo chair
and snapped her fingers at Park. To Eleanor’s
horror – to her ongoing horror – Park came over
and started filling the sink with water. He took a
pink towel down from a big stack, and expertly
Velcroed it around Eleanor’s neck, carefully lifting
out her hair.
‘I’m sorry,’ he whispered. ‘Do you want me
to leave?’
‘No,’ she mouthed, grabbing his shirt. Yes,
she thought. She was already starting to dissolve
with embarrassment. She couldn’t feel the tips of
her fingers.
But if Park left, there’d be no one to stop his
mom if she decided to give Eleanor giant, clawshaped
bangs or a spiral perm. Or both.
Eleanor wouldn’t try to stop her, no matter
what; she was a guest in this garage. She’d eaten
this woman’s food and manhandled her son – she
was in no position to argue.
391/593
Park’s mom pushed him aside and laid Eleanor’s
head firmly back into the sink. ‘What kind of
shampoo you use?’
‘I don’t know,’ Eleanor said.
‘How you not know?’ his mom asked, feeling
her hair. ‘Feels too dry. Curly hair is dry, you
know?’
Eleanor shook her head.
‘Hmmm …’ Park’s mom said. She tipped
Eleanor’s head back into the water and told Park
to go stick a hot-oil pack in the microwave.
It was really, really strange having Park’s
mom wash her hair. She was practically standing
in Eleanor’s lap; her angel necklace hung right
over Eleanor’s mouth. Plus, the whole process
tickled like crazy. Eleanor didn’t know whether
Park was watching. She hoped not.
A few minutes later, her hair was hot-oiled
and wrapped in a towel so tight it hurt her forehead.
Park was sitting across from her, trying to
smile, but looking almost as uncomfortable as
she felt.
392/593
His mom was going through box after box of
Avon samples. ‘I know it’s here somewhere,’ she
said. ‘Cinnamon, cinnamon, cinnamon … A-ha!’
She wheeled her chair over to Eleanor.
‘Okay. Close eyes.’
Eleanor stared at her. She was holding up a
little brown pencil.
‘Close eyes,’ she said again.
‘Why?’ Eleanor said.
‘Don’t worry. This wash off.’
‘But I don’t wear makeup.’
‘Why not?’
Maybe Eleanor should say that she wasn’t allowed
to. That would sound nicer than ‘because
makeup is a lie.’
‘I don’t know,’ Eleanor said, ‘it’s just not
me.’
‘Yes, you,’ his mom said, looking at the pencil.
‘Very good color for you. Cinnamon.’
‘Is that lipstick?’
‘No, eyeliner.’
Eleanor especially didn’t wear eyeliner.
393/593
‘What does it do?’
‘It’s makeup,’ his mom said, exasperated. ‘It
makes you pretty.’
Eleanor felt like she had something in her
eye. Like fire.
‘Mom …’ Park said.
‘Here,’ his mom said. ‘I’ll show you.’ She
turned to Park, and before either of them realized
what she was planning, she had her thumb at the
corner of his eye.
‘Cinnamon too light,’ she muttered. She
picked up a different pencil. ‘Onyx.’
‘Mom …’ Park said painfully, but he didn’t
move.
His mom sat so that Eleanor could see, then
deftly drew a line along Park’s eyelashes.
‘Open.’ He did. ‘Nice … close.’ She did the other
eye, too. Then she added another line under his
eye and licked her thumb to wipe away a
smudge. ‘There, nice.’
‘See?’ she said, sitting back so that Eleanor
could see. ‘Easy. Pretty.’
394/593
Park didn’t look pretty. He looked dangerous.
Like Ming the Merciless. Or a member of Duran
Duran.
‘You look like Robert Smith,’ Eleanor said.
But … yeah, she thought, prettier.
He looked down. Eleanor couldn’t look away.
His mom swooped in between them. ‘Okay,
now close eyes,’ she said to Eleanor. ‘Open. Nice
… Close again …’ It felt exactly like having
someone draw on your eye with a pencil. Then it
was over, and Park’s mom was rubbing
something cold on Eleanor’s cheeks.
‘This very easy routine,’ his mom said.
‘Foundation, powder, eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara,
lip liner, lipstick, blush. Eight steps, take
you fifteen minutes tops.’
Park’s mom was very businesslike, like
someone with a cooking show on PBS. Pretty
soon she was unwrapping Eleanor’s hair and
standing behind her.
Eleanor wanted to look at Park again, now
that she could, but she didn’t want him looking
395/593
back. Her face felt so heavy and sticky, she probably
looked like one of the Designing Women.
Park scooted his chair closer to hers and started
bouncing his fist on her knee. It took Eleanor
a second to realize he was challenging her to a
game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
She played along. God. Any excuse to touch
him. Any excuse not to look at him directly. He’d
rubbed his eyes, so he didn’t look painted anymore
– but he still looked like something Eleanor
didn’t have words for.
‘That’s how Park keep little kids busy during
haircuts,’ his mom said. ‘You must look scared,
Eleanor. Don’t worry. I promise no cutting.’
Eleanor and Park both made scissors.
His mom rubbed half a can of mousse into
her hair, then blew it dry with a diffuser (which
Eleanor had never heard of before but was apparently
very, very important).
According to Park’s mom, everything Eleanor
was doing with her hair – washing it with
396/593
whatever, brushing it, tying in beads and silk
flowers – was dead wrong.
She should be diffusing and scrunching and,
if possible, sleeping on a satin pillowcase.
‘I think you look really good with bangs,’ his
mom said. ‘Maybe next time, we try bangs.’
There will never be a next time, Eleanor
promised herself and God.
‘Okay, all done.’ Park’s mom was all smiles.
‘Look so pretty … Ready to see?’ She turned
Eleanor around to the mirror. ‘Ta-daa!’
Eleanor looked at her own lap.
‘Have to look, Eleanor. Look, mirror, so
pretty.’
Eleanor couldn’t. She could feel them both
watching her. She wanted to disappear, to drop
through a trap door. This whole thing was a bad
idea. A terrible idea. She was going to cry, she
was going to make a scene. Park’s mom was going
to go back to hating her.
‘Hey, Mindy.’ Park’s dad opened the door
and leaned into the garage. ‘Phone call. Oh, hey,
397/593
look at you, Eleanor, you look like a Solid Gold
dancer.’
‘See?’ his mom said, ‘I told you – pretty.
Don’t look in mirror until I come back. Looking
in mirror best part.’
She hurried into the house, and Eleanor hid
her face in her hands, trying not to mess anything
up. She felt Park’s hands on her wrists.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘I guess I knew you’d
hate this, but I didn’t think you’d hate it this
much.’
‘It’s just so embarrassing.’
‘Why?’
‘Because … you’re all looking at me.’
‘I’m always looking at you,’ he said.
‘I know, I wish you’d stop.’
‘She’s just trying to get to know you. This is
her thing.’
‘Do I look like a Solid Gold dancer?’
‘No …’
‘Oh my God,’ she said, ‘I do.’
‘No, you look … just look.’
398/593
‘I don’t want to.’
‘Look now,’ he said, ‘before my mom gets
back.’
‘Only if you close your eyes.’
‘Okay, they’re closed.’
Eleanor uncovered her face and looked in the
mirror. It wasn’t as embarrassing as she thought
– because it was like looking at a different person.
Someone with cheekbones and giant eyes
and really wet lips. Her hair was still curly, curlier
than ever, but calmer somehow. Less
deranged.
Eleanor hated it, she hated all of it.
‘Can I open my eyes?’ Park asked.
‘No.’
‘Are you crying?’
‘No.’ Of course she was. She was going to
ruin her fake face, and Park’s mom was going to
go back to hating her.
Park opened his eyes and sat in front of
Eleanor on the vanity. ‘Is it so bad?’ he asked.
‘It’s not me.’
399/593
‘Of course it’s you.’
‘I just, I look like I’m in costume. Like I’m
trying to be something that I’m not.’
Like she was trying to be pretty and popular.
It was the trying part that was so disgusting.
‘I think your hair looks really nice,’ Park
said.
‘It’s not my hair.’
‘It is …’
‘I don’t want your mom to see me like this. I
don’t want to hurt her feelings.’
‘Kiss me.’
‘What?’
He kissed her. Eleanor felt her shoulders fall
and her stomach untwist. Then it started twisting
in the other direction. She pulled away.
‘Are you kissing me because I look like
someone else?’
‘You don’t look like someone else. Plus,
that’s crazy.’
‘Do you like me better like this?’ she asked.
‘Because I’m never going to look like this again.’
400/593
‘I like you the same … I kind of miss your
freckles.’ He rubbed her cheeks with his sleeve.
‘There,’ he said.
‘You look like a different person,’ she said,
‘and you’re just wearing eyeliner.’
‘Do you like me better?’
She rolled her eyes, but she felt the heat in
her neck. ‘You look different. You look
unsettling.’
‘You look like you,’ he said. ‘You with the
volume turned up.’
She looked in the mirror again.
‘The thing is,’ Park said. ‘I’m pretty sure my
mom was holding back. I think she thinks this is
the natural look.’
Eleanor laughed. The door to the house
opened.
‘Awww, I told you guys to wait,’ his mom
said. ‘Were you surprised?’
Eleanor nodded.
‘Did you cry? Oh, I miss it!’
‘Sorry if I messed it up,’ Eleanor said.
401/593
‘No mess,’ his mom said, ‘waterproof mascara
and stay-put foundation.’
‘Thank you,’ Eleanor said carefully. ‘I could
hardly believe the difference.’
‘I’ll make you a kit,’ his mom said. ‘These all
colors I never use anyway. Here, sit down, Park.
I trim your hair while we here. Looking shaggy
…’
Eleanor sat in front of him and played Rock,
Paper, Scissors on his knee.
Park
She looked like a different person, and Park
didn’t know if he liked it better. Or at all.
He couldn’t figure out why it upset her so
much. Sometimes, it seemed like she was trying
to hide everything that was pretty about her. Like
she wanted to look ugly.
That was something his mother would say.
Which is why he hadn’t said it to Eleanor. (Did
that count as holding back?)
402/593
He got why Eleanor tried so hard to look different.
Sort of. It was because she was different –
because she wasn’t afraid to be. (Or maybe she
was just more afraid of being like everyone else.)
There was something really exciting about
that. He liked being near that, that kind of brave
and crazy.
‘Unsettling, how?’ he’d wanted to ask her.
The next morning, Park took the onyx eyeliner
into the bathroom and put it on. He was
messier than his mom, but he thought that might
look better. More masculine.
He looked in the mirror. ‘This really make
your eyes pop,’ his mom always told her customers,
and it was true. The eyeliner did make his
eyes pop. It also made him look even less white.
Then Park did his hair like he usually did –
flared up in the middle, all messy and tall, like it
was reaching for something. Usually, as soon as
he did that, Park combed his hair out and down
again.
Today he left it wild.
403/593
His dad flipped at breakfast. Flipped. Park tried
to sneak out without seeing him, but his mom
was non-negotiable about breakfast. Park hung
his head over the cereal bowl.
‘What’s wrong with your hair?’ his dad
asked.
‘Nothing.’
‘Wait a minute, look at me … I said look at
me.’
Park lifted his head, but looked away.
‘What the fuck, Park?’
‘Jamie!’ his mother said.
‘Look at him, Mindy, he’s wearing makeup!
Are you fucking kidding me, Park?’
‘No excuse to cuss,’ his mom said. She
looked nervously at Park, like maybe this was her
fault. Maybe it was. Maybe she shouldn’t have
tried out lipstick samples on him when he was in
kindergarten. Not that he wanted to wear lipstick
…
Probably.
404/593
‘Like hell it isn’t,’ his dad roared. ‘Go wash
your face, Park.’
Park stayed where he was.
‘Go wash your face. Park.’
Park took a bite of cereal.
‘Jamie …’ his mom said.
‘No, Mindy. No. I let these boys do pretty
much anything they damn well please. But, no.
Park is not leaving this house looking like a girl.’
‘Plenty of guys wear makeup,’ Park said.
‘What? What are you even talking about?’
‘David Bowie,’ Park said. ‘Marc Bolan.’
‘I’m not listening to this. Wash your face.’
‘Why?’ Park pushed his fists into the table.
‘Because I said so. Because you look like a
girl.’
‘So what else is new?’ Park shoved his cereal
bowl away.
‘What did you say?’
‘I said, what else is new? Isn’t that what you
think?’
405/593
Park felt tears on his cheeks, but he didn’t
want to touch his eyes.
‘Go to school, Park,’ his mom said softly.
‘You miss your bus.’
‘Mindy …’ his dad said, just barely restraining
himself, ‘they’ll tear him apart.’
‘You tell me Park all grown up now, almost
man, make own decisions. So let him make own
decisions. Let him go.’
His dad didn’t say anything; he’d never raise
his voice to Park’s mom. Park saw his opportunity
and left.
He went to his own bus stop, not Eleanor’s. He
wanted to deal with Steve before he saw her. If
Steve was going to beat the shit out of him for
this, Park would prefer that Eleanor not be in the
audience.
But Steve hardly mentioned it.
‘Hey, Park, what the fuck, man, are you
wearing makeup?’
‘Yeah,’ Park said, holding onto his backpack.
406/593
Everyone around Steve tittered, waiting to
see what would happen next.
‘You kind of look like Ozzy, man,’ Steve
said. ‘You look ready to bite the head off a fucking
bat.’
Everybody laughed. Steve bared his teeth at
Tina and growled, and then it was over.
When Eleanor got on the bus, she was in a
good mood. ‘You’re here! I thought maybe you
were sick when you weren’t at my corner.’ He
looked up at her. She looked surprised, then sat
down quietly and looked at her hands.
‘Do I look like one of the Solid Gold dancers?’
he asked finally, when he couldn’t take
any more quiet.
‘No,’ she said, sidelong glancing, ‘you look
…’
‘Unsettling?’ he asked.
She laughed and nodded.
‘Unsettling, how?’ he asked her.
She kissed him with tongue. On the bus.
407/593
CHAPTER 36
Park
Park told Eleanor not to come over after school.
He figured he was grounded. He washed his face
as soon as he got home and sent himself to his
room.
His mom came in to check on him.
‘Am I grounded?’ he asked.
‘I don’t know,’ she said. ‘Did you have a
good day at school?’
Meaning, did anyone try to flush his face
down the toilet?
‘It was fine,’ he said.
A couple of kids had called Park names in the
halls, but it didn’t hurt like he thought it might.
Lots of other people said he looked cool.
His mom sat on his bed. She looked like
she’d had a long day. You could see her lipliner.
She stared at a jumble of Star Wars action
figures piled up on the shelf over his bed. He
hadn’t touched them for years.
‘Park,’ she said, ‘do you … want to look like
girl? Is that what this about? Eleanor dress like
boy. You look like girl?’
‘No …’ Park said. ‘I just like it. I like the
way it feels.’
‘Like girl?’
‘No,’ he said. ‘Like myself.’
‘Your dad …’
‘I don’t want to talk about him.’
His mother sat for another minute, then left.
Park stayed in his room until Josh came to get
him for dinner. His dad didn’t look up when Park
sat down.
‘Where’s Eleanor?’ his dad asked.
‘I thought I was grounded.’
‘You’re not grounded,’ his dad said, concentrating
on his meat loaf.
409/593
Park looked around the table. Only Josh
would look back at him. ‘Are you going to talk to
me about this morning?’ Park asked.
His dad took another bite, chewed it carefully,
then swallowed. ‘No, Park, at the moment I
can’t think of a single thing I’d like to say to
you.’
410/593
CHAPTER 37
Eleanor
Park was right. They were never alone.
She thought about sneaking out again, but the
risk was incomprehensible, and it was so effing
cold out she’d probably lose an ear to frostbite.
Which her mom would definitely notice.
She’d already noticed the mascara. (Even
though it was brown and said ‘Subtle, Natural
Look’ right on the package.)
‘Tina gave it to me,’ Eleanor said. ‘Her
mom’s an Avon lady.’
If she just changed Park’s name to ‘Tina’
every time she lied, it only felt like one big lie instead
of a million small ones.
It was kind of funny to think about hanging
out at Tina’s house every day, doing each other’s
nails, trying on lip gloss …
It would be awful if her mom actually met
Tina somewhere, but that didn’t seem likely – her
mom never talked to anybody in the neighborhood.
If you weren’t born in the Flats (if your
family didn’t go back ten generations, if your
parents didn’t have the same great-great-grandparents),
you were an outsider.
Park always said that was why people left
him alone, even though he was weird and Asian.
Because his family had owned their land back
when the neighborhood was still cornfields.
Park. Eleanor blushed whenever she thought
about him. She’d probably always done that, but
now it was worse. Because he was cute and cool
before, but lately he seemed so much more of
both.
Even DeNice and Beebi thought so.
‘He looks like a rock star,’ DeNice said.
‘He looks like El DeBarge,’ Beebi agreed.
412/593
He looked like himself, Eleanor thought, but
bolder. Like Park with the volume turned way up.
Park
They were never alone.
They tried to make the walk from the bus to
Park’s house last forever, and sometimes, they’d
hang out on his front steps a while … until his
mom opened the door and told them to come in
from the cold.
Maybe it would be better this summer. They
could go outside. Maybe they could take walks.
Maybe he’d get his driver’s license after all …
No. His dad hadn’t even spoken to him since
the day they fought.
‘What’s up with your dad?’ Eleanor asked
him. She was standing one step below him on his
front stoop.
‘He’s mad at me.’
‘For what?’
‘For not being like him.’
413/593
Eleanor looked dubious. ‘Has he been mad at
you for the last sixteen years?’
‘Basically.’
‘But it always seemed like you got along …’
she said.
‘No,’ Park said, ‘never. I mean, we were kind
of getting along for a while, because I finally got
in a fight, and because he thought my mom was
being too hard on you.’
‘I knew she didn’t like me!’ Eleanor poked
Park’s arm.
‘Well, now she likes you,’ he said, ‘so now
my dad is back to not liking me.’
‘Your dad loves you,’ she said. It seemed to
really matter to her.
Park shook his head. ‘Only because he has to.
He’s disappointed in me.’
Eleanor laid her hand on his chest, and his
mom opened the door.
‘Come in, come in,’ she said. ‘Too cold.’
Eleanor
414/593
‘Your hair looks nice, Eleanor,’ Park’s mom said.
‘Thank you.’
Eleanor wasn’t diffusing, but she was using
the conditioner Park’s mom had given her. And
she’d actually found a satin pillowcase in the
stack of towels and stuff in her bedroom closet,
which was practically a sign from God that He
wanted Eleanor to take better care of her hair.
Park’s mom really did seem to like her better
now. Eleanor hadn’t consented to another full-on
makeover, but Park’s mom was always trying
new eyeshadows on her or messing with her hair
while she sat at the kitchen table with Park.
‘I should have had girl,’ his mom said.
I should have had a family like this, Eleanor
thought. And it only sometimes made her feel
like a traitor to think so.
415/593
CHAPTER 38
Eleanor
Wednesday nights were the worst.
Park had taekwando, so Eleanor went straight
home after school, took a bath, then tried to hide
in her room all night, reading.
It was way too cold to play outside, so the
little kids were crawling up the walls. When
Richie came home, there was no place for anybody
to hide.
Ben was so afraid that Richie would send him
to the basement early that he was sitting in the
bedroom closet, playing with his cars.
When Richie turned on Mike Hammer their
mom shooed Maisie into the bedroom, too, even
though Richie said she could stay.
Maisie paced the room, bored and irritable.
She walked over to the bunk bed.
‘Can I come up?’
‘No.’
‘Please …’
Their beds were junior-sized, smaller than a
twin, just barely big enough for Eleanor. And
Maisie wasn’t one of those stringy, weightless
nine-year-olds …
‘Fine,’ Eleanor groaned.
She scooted over carefully, like she was on
thin ice, and pushed her grapefruit box behind
her into the corner.
Maisie climbed up and sat on Eleanor’s pillow.
‘What’re you reading?’
‘Watership Down.’
Maisie wasn’t paying attention. She folded
her arms and leaned toward Eleanor. ‘We know
you have a boyfriend,’ she whispered.
Eleanor’s heart stopped. ‘I don’t have a boyfriend,’
she said blankly – and immediately.
‘We already know,’ Maisie said.
417/593
Eleanor looked over at Ben, sitting in the
closet. He stared at her without giving up a thing.
Thanks to Richie, they were all experts in the
blank-face department. They should find some
family poker tournament …
‘Bobbie told us,’ Maisie said. ‘Her big sister
goes with Josh Sheridan, and Josh says you’re his
brother’s girlfriend. Ben said you weren’t, and
Bobbie laughed at him.’
Ben didn’t flinch.
‘Are you going to tell Mom?’ Eleanor asked.
May as well cut to the chase.
‘We haven’t told her yet,’ Maisie said.
‘Are you going to?’ Eleanor resisted the urge
to shove Maisie off the bed. Maisie would go
nuclear.
‘He’ll make me leave, you know,’ Eleanor
said fiercely. ‘If I’m lucky, that’s the worst that’ll
happen.’
‘We’re not going to tell,’ Ben whispered.
‘But it’s not fair,’ Maisie said, slumping
against the wall.
418/593
‘What?’ Eleanor said.
‘It’s not fair that you get to leave all the
time,’ Maisie said.
‘What do you want me to do?’ Eleanor asked.
They both stared at her, desperate and almost …
almost hopeful.
Everything anybody ever said in this house
was desperate.
Desperate was white noise, as far as Eleanor
was concerned – it was the hope that pulled at her
heart with dirty little fingers.
She was pretty sure she was wired wrong
somewhere, that her plugs were switched, because
instead of softening toward them – instead
of tenderness – she felt herself go cold and mean.
‘I can’t take you with me,’ she said, ‘if that’s
what you’re thinking.’
‘Why not?’ Ben said. ‘We’ll just hang out
with the other kids.’
‘There are no other kids,’ Eleanor said, ‘it’s
not like that.’
‘You don’t care about us,’ Maisie said.
419/593
‘I do care,’ Eleanor hissed. ‘I just can’t …
help you.’
The door opened, and Mouse wandered in.
‘Ben, Ben, Ben, where’s my car, Ben? Where’s
my car? Ben?’ He jumped on Ben for no reason.
Sometimes you didn’t know until after Mouse
jumped on you whether he was hugging you or
trying to kill you.
Ben tried to push Mouse off as quietly as he
could. Eleanor threw a book at him. (A paperback.
God.)
Mouse ran out of the room, and Eleanor
leaned out of her bed to close the door. She could
practically open her dresser without getting out
of bed.
‘I can’t help you,’ she said. It felt like letting
go of them in deep water. ‘I can’t even help
myself.’
Maisie’s face was hard.
‘Please don’t tell,’ Eleanor said.
Maisie and Ben exchanged looks again, then
Maisie, still hard and gray, turned to Eleanor.
420/593
‘Will you let us use your stuff?’
‘What stuff?’ Eleanor asked.
‘Your comics,’ Ben said.
‘They’re not mine.’
‘Your makeup,’ Maisie said.
They’d probably catalogued her whole freaking
bed. Her grapefruit box was packed with contraband
these days, all of it from Park … They
were already into everything, she was sure.
‘You have to put it away when you’re done,’
Eleanor said. ‘And the comics aren’t mine, Ben,
they’re borrowed. You have to keep them nice …
‘And if you get caught,’ she turned to Maisie,
‘Mom will take it all away. Especially the
makeup. None of us will have it then.’
They both nodded.
‘I would have let you use some, anyway,’ she
said to Maisie. ‘You just had to ask.’
‘Liar,’ Maisie said.
And she was right.
Park
421/593
Wednesdays were the worst.
No Eleanor. And his dad ignored him all
through dinner and taekwando.
Park wondered if it was just the eyeliner that
had done it – or if the eyeliner had been the pencil
that broke the camel’s back. Like Park had
spent sixteen years acting weak and weird and
girlie, and his dad had borne it on his massive
shoulders. And then one day, Park put on
makeup, and that was it, his dad just shrugged
him off.
Your dad loves you, Eleanor said. And she
was right. But it didn’t matter. That was table
stakes. His dad loved him in a completely obligatory
way, like Park loved Josh.
His dad couldn’t stand the sight of him.
Park kept wearing eyeliner to school. And he
kept washing it off when he got home. And his
dad kept acting like he wasn’t there.
Eleanor
422/593
It was just a matter of time now. If Maisie and
Ben knew, their mom would find out. Either the
kids would tell her, or she’d find some clue
Eleanor had overlooked, or something … It
would be something.
Eleanor didn’t have anywhere to hide her
secrets. In a box, on her bed. At Park’s house, a
block away.
She was running out of time with him.
423/593
CHAPTER 39
Eleanor
Thursday night after dinner, Park’s grandma
came over to have her hair set, and his mom disappeared
into the garage. His dad was messing
with the plumbing under the sink, replacing the
garbage disposal. Park was trying to tell Eleanor
about a tape he’d bought. Elvis Costello. He
couldn’t shut up about it.
‘There are a couple songs you might like, ballady
stuff. But the rest is really fast.’
‘Like punk?’ She wrinkled her nose. She
could stand a few Dead Milkmen songs, but other
than that, she hated Park’s punk music. ‘I feel
like they’re yelling at me,’ she’d say when he
tried to put punk on her mix tapes. ‘Stop yelling
at me, Glenn Danzig!’
‘That’s Henry Rollins.’
‘They all sound the same when they’re
yelling at me.’
Lately, Park was really into New Wave music.
Or post-punk or something. He went through
bands like Eleanor went through books.
‘No,’ he said, ‘Elvis Costello is more musical.
Gentler. I’ll dub you a copy.’
‘Or you could just play it for me. Now.’
Park tilted his head. ‘That would involve going
into my room.’
‘Okay,’ she said, not quite casually.
‘Okay?’ he asked. ‘Months of no, and now,
okay?’
‘Okay,’ Eleanor said. ‘You’re always saying
that your mom doesn’t care …’
‘My mom doesn’t care.’
‘So?’
Park stood up jerkily, grinning, and pulled
her up. He stopped at the kitchen. ‘We’re going
to listen to music in my room.’
425/593
‘Fine,’ his dad said from under the sink. ‘Just
don’t get anybody pregnant.’
That should have been embarrassing, but
Park’s dad had a way of cutting past embarrassing.
Eleanor wished he wasn’t ignoring them all
the time.
Park’s mom probably let him have girls in his
room because you could practically see into his
room from the living room, and you had to walk
by to get to the bathroom.
But, to Eleanor, it still felt incredibly private.
She couldn’t get over the fact that Park spent
most of his time in this room horizontal. (It was
only a ninety-degree difference, but imagining
him that way blew all her fuses.) Also, he
changed his clothes in here.
There was no place to sit but on his bed,
which Eleanor wouldn’t consider. So they sat
between his bed and his stereo, where there was
just enough room to sit with their legs bent.
As soon as they sat down, Park started fastforwarding
through the Elvis Costello tape. He
426/593
had stacks and stacks of tapes, and Eleanor
pulled a few out to look at them.
‘Ah …’ Park said, pained.
‘What?’
‘Those’re alphabetized.’
‘It’s okay. I know the alphabet.’
‘Right.’ He looked embarrassed. ‘Sorry.
Whenever Cal comes over, he always messes
them up. Okay, this is the song I wanted you to
hear. Listen.’
‘Cal comes over?’
‘Yeah, sometimes.’ Park turned up the
volume. ‘It’s been a while.’
‘Because now I just come over …’
‘Which is okay with me because I like you a
lot more.’
‘But don’t you miss your other friends?’ she
asked.
‘You’re not listening,’ he said.
‘Neither are you.’
He paused the tape, like he didn’t want to
waste this song as background music. ‘Sorry,’ he
427/593
said. ‘We’re talking about whether I miss Cal? I
eat lunch with him almost every day.’
‘And he doesn’t mind that you spend the rest
of your time with me now? None of your friends
mind?’
Park ran his hand through his hair. ‘I still see
them all at school … I don’t know, I don’t really
miss them, I’ve never really missed anybody but
you.’
‘But you don’t miss me now,’ she said.
‘We’re together all the time.’
‘Are you kidding? I miss you constantly.’
Even though Park washed his face as soon as
he got home, the black around his eyes didn’t
come off completely. It made everything he did
lately seem more dramatic.
‘That’s crazy,’ she said.
Park started laughing. ‘I know …’
She wanted to tell him about Maisie and Ben
and their days being numbered, etc., but he
wouldn’t understand, and what did she expect
him to do?
428/593
Park pushed play.
‘What’s this song called?’ she asked.
“‘Alison.”’
Park
Park played Elvis Costello for her – and Joe
Jackson, and Jonathan Richman and the Modern
Lovers.
She teased him because it was all so pretty
and melodic, and ‘in the same phylum as Hall &
Oates,’ and he threatened to evict her from his
room.
When his mom came to check on them, they
were sitting with a hundred cassette tapes
between them, and as soon as she walked away,
Park leaned over and kissed Eleanor. It seemed
like the best time not to get caught.
She was a little too far away, so he put his
hand on her back and pulled her toward him. He
tried to do it like it was something he did all the
429/593
time, as if touching her someplace new wasn’t
like discovering the Northwest Passage.
Eleanor came closer. She put her hands on
the floor between them and leaned into him,
which was so encouraging that he put his other
hand on her waist. And then it was too much to
be almost-but-not-really holding her. Park rocked
forward onto his knees and pulled her tighter.
Half a dozen cassette tapes cracked under
their weight. Eleanor fell back, and Park fell
forward.
‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘Oh, God … look, what
we did to Meat is Murder.’
Park sat back and looked at the tapes. He
wanted to sweep them out of the way. ‘It’s
mostly just the cases, I think,’ he said. ‘Don’t
worry about it.’ He started picking up the broken
plastic.
‘The Smiths and the Smithereens …’ she
said. ‘We even broke them in alphabetical order.’
430/593
He tried to smile at her, but she wouldn’t look
at him. ‘I should go,’ she said. ‘I think it’s almost
eight, anyway.’
‘Oh. Okay, I’ll walk you.’
She stood up and Park followed her. They
walked outside and down the walk, and when
they got to his grandparents’ driveway, Eleanor
didn’t stop.
Eleanor
Maisie smelled like an Avon lady, and she was
made up like the whore of Babylon. They were
definitely going to get caught. Talk about a house
of effing cards. Jee. Zus.
And Eleanor couldn’t even think strategy, because
all she could think about was Park’s hands
on her waist and her back and her stomach –
which all must feel like nothing he’d ever encountered.
Everyone in Park’s family was skinny
enough to be in a Special K commercial. Even
his grandma.
431/593
Eleanor could only be in that scene where the
actress pinches an inch, then looks at the camera
like the world is going to end.
Actually, she’d have to lose weight to be in
that scene. You could pinch an inch – or two, or
three – all over Eleanor’s body. You could probably
pinch an inch on her forehead.
Holding hands was fine. Her hands weren’t a
complete embarrassment. And kissing seemed
safe because fat lips are okay – and because Park
usually closed his eyes.
But there was no safe place on Eleanor’s
torso. There was no place from her neck to her
knees where she had any discernible
infrastructure.
As soon as Park touched her waist, she’d
sucked in her stomach and pitched forward.
Which led to all the collateral damage … which
made her feel like Godzilla. (But even Godzilla
wasn’t fat. He was just ginormous.)
The maddening part was, Eleanor wanted
Park to touch her again. She wanted him to touch
432/593
her constantly. Even if it led to Park deciding that
she was way too much like a walrus to remain his
girlfriend … That’s how good it felt. She was
like one of those dogs who’ve tasted human
blood and can’t stop biting. A walrus who’s
tasted human blood.
433/593
CHAPTER 40
Eleanor
Park wanted Eleanor to start checking her books
now, especially after gym class.
‘Because if it is Tina,’ he said – you could
tell that he still didn’t believe that it was, ‘you
need to tell somebody.’
‘Tell who?’ They were sitting in his room,
leaning against his bed, trying to pretend that
Park didn’t have his arm around her for the first
time since she crushed his cassette tapes. Just
barely, not quite around her.
‘You could tell Mrs Dunne,’ he said. ‘She
likes you.’
‘Okay, so I tell Mrs Dunne, and I show her
whatever awful thing Tina has misspelled on my
books – and then Mrs Dunne asks, “How do you
know that Tina wrote that?” She’ll be just as
skeptical as you were, but without the complicated
romantic history …’
‘There’s no complicated romantic history,’
Park said.
‘Did you kiss her?’ Eleanor hadn’t meant to
ask that. Out loud. It was almost like she’d asked
it so many times in her head that it leaked out.
‘Mrs Dunne? No. But we’ve hugged a lot.’
‘You know what I mean … Did you kiss
her?’
She was sure that he’d kissed her. She was
sure that they’d done other stuff, too. Tina was so
little, Park could probably wrap his arms all the
way around her and shake his own hands at her
waist.
‘I don’t want to talk about this,’ he said.
‘Because you did,’ Eleanor said.
‘It doesn’t matter.’
‘It does matter. Was it your first kiss?’
‘Yeah,’ he said, ‘and that’s one of the reasons
it doesn’t count. It was like a practice pitch.’
435/593
‘What are the other reasons?’
‘It was Tina, I was twelve, I didn’t even like
girls yet …’
‘But you’ll always remember it,’ she said. ‘It
was your first kiss.’
‘I’ll remember that it didn’t matter,’ Park
said.
Eleanor wanted to let this go – the most trustworthy
voices in her head were shouting, ‘Let it
go!’
‘But …’ she said, ‘how could you kiss her?’
‘I was twelve.’
‘But she’s awful.’
‘She was twelve, too.’
‘But … how could you kiss her and then kiss
me?’
‘I didn’t even know you existed.’ Park’s arm
suddenly made contact, full contact, with Eleanor’s
waist. He pressed into her side, and she sat
up, instinctively, trying to spread herself thinner.
‘There aren’t even roads between Tina and
me …’ she said. ‘How could you like us both?
436/593
Did you have a life-changing head injury in junior
high?’
Park put his other arm around her. ‘Please.
Listen to me. It was nothing. It doesn’t matter.’
‘It matters,’ Eleanor whispered. Now that his
arms were around her, there was almost no space
between them. ‘Because you were the first person
I ever kissed. And that matters.’
He set his forehead against hers. She didn’t
know what to do with her eyes or her hands.
‘Nothing before you counts,’ he said. ‘And I
can’t even imagine an after.’
She shook her head. ‘Don’t.’
‘What?’
‘Don’t talk about after.’
‘I just meant that … I want to be the last person
who ever kisses you, too … That sounds bad,
like a death threat or something. What I’m trying
to say is, you’re it. This is it for me.’
‘Don’t.’ She didn’t want him to talk like this.
She’d meant to push him, but not this far.
‘Eleanor …’
437/593
‘I don’t want to think about an after.’
‘That’s what I’m saying, maybe there won’t
be one.’
‘Of course there will.’ She put her hands on
his chest, so that she could push him away if she
had to. ‘I mean … God, of course there will. It’s
not like we’re going to get married, Park.’
‘Not now.’
‘Stop.’ She tried to roll her eyes, but it hurt.
‘I’m not proposing,’ he said. ‘I’m just saying
… I love you. And I can’t imagine stopping …’
She shook her head. ‘But you’re twelve.’
‘I’m sixteen …’ he said. ‘Bono was fifteen
when he met his wife, and Robert Smith was
fourteen …’
‘Romeo, sweet Romeo …’
‘It’s not like that, Eleanor, and you know it.’
Park’s arms were tight around her. All the playfulness
in his voice was gone. ‘There’s no reason
to think we’re going to stop loving each other,’
he said. ‘And there’s every reason to think that
we won’t.’
438/593
I never said I loved you, Eleanor thought.
And even after he kissed her, she kept her
hands on his chest.
So. Anyway. Park wanted her to start checking
her book covers. Especially after gym class. So
now Eleanor waited until almost everybody else
had changed and left the locker room, and then
she carefully examined her books for anything
suspicious.
It was all very clinical.
DeNice and Beebi usually waited with her. It
meant that they were late for lunch sometimes,
but it also meant that they could all change in relative
privacy, which they should have thought of
months ago.
There didn’t seem to be anything pervy written
on Eleanor’s books today. In fact, Tina had
ignored her all through class. Even Tina’s
sidekicks (even thuggy Annette) seemed bored
with Eleanor.
439/593
‘I think they’ve run out of ways to make fun
of my hair,’ Eleanor said to DeNice while she
looked over her algebra book.
‘They could call you “Ronald McDonald,”’
DeNice said. ‘Have they called you that?’
‘Or “Wendy,”’ Beebi said, lowering her voice
and wolfing, ‘Where’s the beef?’
‘Shut up,’ Eleanor said, looking around the
locker room. ‘Little pitchers.’
‘They’re all gone,’ DeNice said.
‘Everybody’s gone. They’re all in the cafeteria,
eating my Macho Nachos. Hurry up, girl.’
‘You go ahead,’ Eleanor said. ‘Get us a place
in line. I still have to change.’
‘All right,’ DeNice said, ‘but stop looking at
those books. You said it yourself, there’s nothing
there. Come on, Beebi.’
Eleanor started packing up her books. She
heard Beebi shout, ‘Where’s the beef?’ from the
locker-room door. Dork. Eleanor opened up her
locker.
It was empty.
440/593
Huh.
She tried the one above it. Nothing. And
nothing below. No …
Eleanor started over, opening all the lockers
on the wall, then moving on to the next wall, trying
not to panic. Maybe they’d just moved her
clothes. Ha. Funny. Super-good joke, Tina.
‘What are you doing?’ Mrs Burt asked.
‘Looking for my clothes,’ Eleanor said.
‘You should use the same locker every time,
so it’s easy to remember.’
‘No, somebody … I mean, I think somebody
took them.’
‘Those little bitches …’ Mrs Burt sighed.
Like she couldn’t imagine a bigger hassle.
Mrs Burt started opening lockers at the other
end of the room. Eleanor checked the trash and
the showers. Then Mrs Burt called out from the
bathroom. ‘Found them!’
Eleanor walked into the bathroom. The floor
was wet, and Mrs Burt was standing in a stall.
441/593
‘I’ll get a bag,’ Mrs Burt said, pushing past
Eleanor.
Eleanor looked down at the toilet. Even
though she knew what she was going to see there,
it still felt like a wet slap in the face. Her new
jeans and her cowboy shirt were in a dark pile in
the bowl, and her shoes were crammed under the
lip. Somebody had flushed the toilet, and there
was water still spilling over the edge. Eleanor
watched it run.
‘Here,’ Mrs Burt said, handing Eleanor a yellow
Food 4 Less bag. ‘Fish ’em out.’
‘I don’t want them,’ Eleanor said, backing
away. She couldn’t wear them anymore anyway.
Everybody would know those were her toilet
clothes.
‘Well, you can’t leave them here,’ Mrs Burt
said. ‘Fish them out.’ Eleanor stared at her
clothes. ‘Come on,’ Mrs Burt said.
Eleanor reached into the toilet and felt tears
slipping down her cheeks. Mrs Burt held the bag
442/593
open. ‘You’ve got to stop letting them get to you,
you know,’ she said. ‘You just encourage them.’
Yeah, thanks, Eleanor thought, wringing out
her jeans over the toilet. She wanted to wipe her
eyes, but her hands were wet.
Mrs Burt handed her the bag. ‘Come on,’ she
said. ‘I’ll write you a pass.’
‘For where?’ Eleanor asked.
‘Your counselor’s office.’
Eleanor took a sharp breath. ‘I can’t walk
down the hall like this.’
‘What do you want from me, Eleanor?’ That
was obviously a rhetorical question; Mrs Burt
wasn’t even looking at her. Eleanor followed her
to the coach’s office and waited for the pass.
As soon as she got out to the hallway, the
tears came on hard. She couldn’t walk through
the school like this – in her gymsuit. In front of
boys … And everybody. In front of Tina. God,
Tina was probably selling tickets outside the
cafeteria. Eleanor couldn’t do it. Not like this.
443/593
It wasn’t just that her gymsuit was ugly.
(Polyester. One-piece. Red-and-white stripes
with an extra-long white zipper.)
It was also extremely tight.
The shorts just barely cleared her underwear,
and the fabric was stretched so tight over her
chest, the seams were starting to pop under her
arms.
She was a tragedy in that gymsuit. A ten-car
pileup.
People were already showing up for the next
gym class. A few freshman girls looked at Eleanor,
then started whispering. Her bag was
dripping.
Before she could think it through, Eleanor
turned the wrong way down the hall and headed
for the door to the football field. She acted like
she was supposed to be walking out of the building
in the middle of the day, like she was on
some kind of weeping/half-dressed/drippy-bag
mission.
444/593
The door clicked locked behind her, and
Eleanor crouched against it, letting herself fall
apart. Just for a minute. God. God.
There was a trash can sitting right outside the
door, and she got up and hurled the Food 4 Less
bag into it. She wiped her eyes with her gymsuit.
Okay, she told herself, taking a deep breath, get it
together. Don’t let them get to you. Those were
her new jeans in the trash. And her favorite
shoes. Her Vans. She walked over to the trash
and shook her head, reaching down for the bag.
Fuck you, Tina. Fuck you to the moon.
She took another deep breath and started
walking.
There were no classrooms at this end of the
school, so at least no one was watching her. She
stuck close to the building, and when she turned
the corner, she walked under a row of windows.
She thought about walking right home, but that
might be worse. It’d definitely be longer.
If she could just get to the front door, the
counselor’s offices were right inside. Mrs Dunne
445/593
would help her. Mrs Dunne wouldn’t tell her not
to cry.
The security guard at the front door acted like
girls were wandering in and out in their gym
clothes all day long. He glanced at Eleanor’s pass
and waved her on.
Almost there, Eleanor thought. Don’t run, just
a few more doors …
She really should have expected Park to walk
through one of them.
Ever since the first day they’d met, Eleanor
was always seeing him in unexpected places. It
was like their lives were overlapping lines, like
they had their own gravity. Usually, that
serendipity felt like the nicest thing the universe
had ever done for her.
Park walked out of a door on the opposite
side of the hallway and stopped as soon as he saw
her. She tried to look away, but she didn’t do it
soon enough. Park’s face turned red. He stared at
her. She pulled down her shorts and stumbled
446/593
forward, running the last few steps to the counselors’
offices.
‘You don’t have to go back there,’ her mom said
after Eleanor had told her the whole story. (Almost
the whole story.)
Eleanor thought for a moment about what
she’d do if she didn’t go back to school. Stay
here all day? And then what?
‘It’s okay,’ she said. Mrs Dunne had driven
Eleanor home herself, and she’d promised to
bring a padlock for her gym locker.
Eleanor’s mom dumped the yellow plastic
bag into the bathtub and started rinsing out the
clothes, wrinkling her nose, even though they
didn’t smell.
‘Girls are so mean …’ she said. ‘You’re
lucky to have one friend you can trust.’
Eleanor must have looked confused.
‘Tina,’ her mom said. ‘You’re lucky to have
Tina.’
Eleanor nodded.
447/593
She stayed home that night. Even though it
was Friday, and Park’s family always watched
movies and made popcorn in the air popper on
Fridays.
She couldn’t face him.
All she’d see was the look on his face in the
hallway. She’d feel like she was still standing
there in her gymsuit.
448/593
CHAPTER 41
Park
Park went to bed early. His mom kept bothering
him about Eleanor. ‘Where’s Eleanor tonight?’
‘She running late?’ ‘You get in fight?’
Every time she said Eleanor’s name, Park felt
his face go hot.
‘I can tell that something wrong,’ his mom
said at dinner. ‘Did you get in fight? Did you
break up again?’
‘No,’ Park said. ‘I think maybe she went
home sick. She wasn’t on the bus.’
‘I have a girlfriend now,’ Josh said, ‘can she
start coming over?’
‘No girlfriend,’ their mom said, ‘too young.’
‘I’m almost thirteen!’
‘Sure,’ their dad said, ‘your girlfriend can
come over. If you’re willing to give up your
Nintendo.’
‘What?’ Josh was stricken. ‘Why?’
‘Because I said so,’ his dad said. ‘Is it a
deal?’
‘No! No way,’ Josh said. ‘Does Park have to
give up Nintendo?’
‘Yep. Is that okay with you, Park?’
‘Fine.’
‘I’m like Billy Jack,’ their dad said, ‘a warrior
and a wise-man.’
It wasn’t much of a conversation, but it was
the most his dad had said to Park in weeks.
Maybe his dad had been bracing for the entire
neighborhood to swarm the house with torches
and pitchforks as soon as they saw Park with
eyeliner …
But almost nobody cared. Not even his grandparents.
(His grandma said he looked like
Rudolph Valentino, and he heard his grandpa tell
450/593
his dad, ‘You should have seen what kids looked
like while you were in Korea.’)
‘I’m going to bed,’ Park said, standing up
from the table. ‘I don’t feel well either.’
‘So if Park doesn’t get to play Nintendo anymore,’
Josh asked, ‘can I put it in my room?’
‘Park can play Nintendo whenever he wants,’
their dad said.
‘God,’ Josh said, ‘everything you guys do is
unfair.’
Park turned off his light and crawled onto his
bed. He lay on his back because he didn’t trust
his front. Or his hands, actually. Or his brain.
After he saw Eleanor today, it hadn’t occurred
to him, not for at least an hour, to wonder
why she was walking down the hall in her gymsuit.
And it took him another hour to realize he
should have said something to her. He could have
said, ‘Hey’ or ‘What’s going on?’ or ‘Are you
OK?’ Instead he’d stared at her like he’d never
seen her before.
He felt like he’d never seen her before.
451/593
It’s not like he hadn’t thought about it (a lot)
– Eleanor under her clothes. But he could never
fill in any of the details. The only women he
could actually picture naked were the women in
the magazines his dad every once in a while remembered
to hide under his bed.
Magazines like that made Eleanor freak. Just
mention Hugh Hefner, and she’d be off for half
an hour on prostitution and slavery and the Fall
of Rome. Park hadn’t told her about his dad’s
twenty-year-old Playboys, but he hadn’t touched
them since he met her.
He could fill in some of the details now. He
could picture Eleanor. He couldn’t stop picturing
her. Why hadn’t he ever noticed how tight those
gymsuits were? And how short …
And why hadn’t he expected her to be so
grown up? To have so much negative space?
He closed his eyes and saw her again. A stack
of freckled heart shapes, a perfectly made Dairy
Queen ice cream cone. Like Betty Boop drawn
with a heavy hand.
452/593
Hey, he thought. What’s going on? Are you
okay?
She must not be. She hadn’t been on the bus
on the way home. She hadn’t come over after
school. And tomorrow was Saturday. What if he
didn’t see her all weekend?
How could he even look at her now? He
wouldn’t be able to. Not without stripping her
down to her gymsuit. Without thinking about that
long white zipper.
Jesus.
453/593
CHAPTER 42
Park
His family was going to the boat show the next
day, then out to lunch, and maybe to the mall …
Park took forever to eat his breakfast and take
a shower.
‘Come on, Park,’ his dad said sharply, ‘get
dressed and put your makeup on.’
Like he’d wear makeup to the boat show.
‘Come on,’ his mom said, checking her lipstick
in the hall mirror, ‘you know your dad hate
crowds.’
‘Do I have to go?’
‘You don’t want to go?’ She scrunched and
fluffed the back of her hair.
‘No, I do,’ Park said. He didn’t. ‘But what if
Eleanor comes over? I don’t want to miss the
chance to talk to her.’
‘Is something wrong? You sure you didn’t
fight?’
‘No, no fight. I’m just … worried about her.
And you know I can’t call her house.’
His mom turned away from the mirror. ‘Okay
…’ she said, frowning. ‘You stay. But vacuum,
okay? And put away big pile of black clothes on
your floor.’
‘Thanks,’ Park said. He hugged her.
‘Park! Mindy!’ His dad was standing at the
front door. ‘Let’s go!’
‘Park staying home,’ his mom said. ‘We go.’
His dad flashed him a look, but didn’t argue.
Park wasn’t used to being home alone. He vacuumed.
He put his clothes away. He made himself
a sandwich and watched a Young Ones marathon
on MTV, then fell asleep on the couch.
When he heard the doorbell, he jerked up to
answer it before he was awake. His heart was
455/593
pounding, the way it does sometimes when you
sleep too hard in the middle of the day, like you
can’t remember how to wake up.
He was sure it was Eleanor. He opened the
door without checking.
Eleanor
Their car wasn’t in the driveway, so Eleanor
figured Park’s family wasn’t home. They were
probably off doing awesome family stuff. Eating
lunch at Bonanza and having their portraits taken
in matching sweaters.
She’d already given up on the door when it
opened. And before she could act embarrassed
and uncomfortable about yesterday – or pretend
that she wasn’t – Park was opening the screen
door and pulling her in by her sleeve.
He didn’t even close the door before he put
his arms around her, his entire arms, all down the
length of her back.
456/593
Park usually held Eleanor with his hands on
her waist, like they were slow-dancing. This
wasn’t slow-dancing. This was … something
else. His arms were around her, and his face was
in her hair, and there was no place for the rest of
her to go but against him.
He was warm … Like really warm and fuzzysoft.
Like a sleeping baby, she thought. (Sort of.
Not exactly.)
She tried to feel embarrassed again.
Park kicked the door closed and fell back on
it, pulling her even tighter. His hair was clean
and straight and flopping into his eyes, and his
eyes were nearly closed. Fuzzy. Soft.
‘Were you sleeping?’ she whispered. Like he
still might be.
He didn’t answer, but his mouth fell on hers,
open, and her head fell back into his hand. He
was holding her so close, there was nowhere to
hide. She couldn’t sit up or suck in or keep any
secrets.
457/593
Park made a noise, and it hummed in her
throat. She could feel all ten of his fingers. On
her neck, on her back … Her own hands hung
stupidly at her side. Like they weren’t even in the
same scene as his. Like she wasn’t even in the
same scene.
Park must have noticed, because he pulled his
mouth back. He tried to wipe it on the shoulder
of his T-shirt, and he looked at her like he was
seeing her for the first time since she got there.
‘Hey …’ he said, taking a breath, focusing.
‘What’s going on? Are you okay?’
Eleanor looked at Park’s face, so full of
something she couldn’t quite place. His chin
hung forward, like his mouth didn’t want to pull
away from her, and his eyes were so green they
could turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.
He was touching her all the places she was
afraid to be touched …
Eleanor tried one last time to be embarrassed.
Park
458/593
For a second, he thought he’d gone too far.
He hadn’t even meant to, he was practically
sleepwalking. And he’d been thinking about
Eleanor, dreaming about her, for so many hours;
wanting her made him stupid.
She was so still in his arms. He thought for a
second that he’d gone too far, that he’d tripped a
wire.
And then Eleanor touched him. She touched
his neck.
It’s hard to say why this was different from
all the other times she’d touched him. She was
different. She was still and then she wasn’t.
She touched his neck, then drew a line down
his chest. Park wished that he was taller and
broader; he hoped she wouldn’t stop.
She was so gentle compared to him. Maybe
she didn’t want him like he wanted her. But even
if she wanted him half as much …
Eleanor
459/593
This is how she touched him in her head.
From jaw to neck to shoulder.
He was so much warmer than she expected,
and harder. Like all of his muscles and bones
were right on the surface, like his heart was beating
just under his T-shirt.
She touched Park softly, gingerly, just in case
she touched him wrong.
Park
He relaxed against the door.
He felt Eleanor’s hand on his throat, on his
chest, then took her other hand and pressed it to
his face. He made a noise like he was hurt and
decided to feel self-conscious about it later.
If he was shy now, he wouldn’t get anything
that he wanted.
Eleanor
460/593
Park was alive, and she was awake, and this was
allowed.
He was hers.
To have and hold. Not forever, maybe – not
forever, for sure – and not figuratively. But literally.
And now. Now, he was hers. And he wanted
her to touch him. He was like a cat who pushes
its head under your hands.
Eleanor brought her hands down Park’s chest
with her fingertips apart, then brought them up
again under his shirt.
She did it because she wanted to. And because
once she started touching him the way she
did in her head, it was hard to stop. And because
… what if she never had the chance to touch him
like this again?
Park
When he felt her fingers on his stomach, he made
the noise again. He held her to him and pushed
461/593
forward, pushing Eleanor backward – stumbling
around the coffee table to the couch.
In movies, this happens smoothly or comically.
In Park’s living room, it was just awkward.
They wouldn’t let go of each other, so Eleanor
fell back, and Park fell against her in the corner
of the couch.
He wanted to look in her eyes, but it was hard
when they were this close. ‘Eleanor …’ he
whispered.
She nodded.
‘I love you,’ he said.
She looked up at him, her eyes shiny and
black, then looked away. ‘I know,’ she said.
He pulled one of his arms out from under her
and traced her outline against the couch. He
could spend all day like this, running his hand
down her ribs, into her waist, out to her hips and
back again … If he had all day, he would. If she
weren’t made of so many other miracles.
462/593
‘You know?’ he repeated. She smiled, so he
kissed her. ‘You’re not the Han Solo in this relationship,
you know.’
‘I’m totally the Han Solo,’ she whispered. It
was good to hear her. It was good to remember it
was Eleanor under all this new flesh.
‘Well, I’m not the Princess Leia,’ he said.
‘Don’t get so hung up on gender roles,’
Eleanor said. Park ran his hand out to her hip and
back again, catching his thumb under her sweater.
She swallowed and lifted her chin.
He pulled her sweater up farther and, then,
without thinking about why, he pulled up his
shirt, too, and laid his bare stomach against hers.
Eleanor’s face crumpled, and it made him
come unhinged.
‘You can be Han Solo,’ he said, kissing her
throat. ‘And I’ll be Boba Fett. I’ll cross the sky
for you.’
Eleanor
463/593
Things she knew now, that she hadn’t known two
hours ago:
Park was covered with skin. Everywhere.
And it was all just as smooth and honeybeautiful
as the skin on his hands. It felt
thick and richer in some places, more like
crushed velvet than silk. But it was all his.
And all wonderful.
She was also covered with skin. And her
skin was apparently covered with superpowered
nerve endings that hadn’t done a
damn thing her whole life, but came alive
like ice and fire and bee stings as soon as
Park touched her. Wherever Park touched
her.
As embarrassed as she was of her stomach
and her freckles and the fact that her bra was
held together with two safety pins, she
wanted Park to touch her more than she
could ever feel embarrassed. And when he
464/593
touched her, he didn’t seem to care about
any of those things. Some of them he even
liked. Like her freckles. He said she was
candy-sprinkled.
She wanted him to touch her everywhere.
He’d stopped at the edge of her bra and only
dipped his fingers into the back of her jeans – but
it wasn’t Eleanor who stopped him. She never
would. When Park touched her, it felt better than
anything she’d ever felt in her whole life. Ever.
And she wanted to feel that way as much she
could. She wanted to stock up on him.
Nothing was dirty. With Park.
Nothing could be shameful.
Because Park was the sun, and that was the
only way Eleanor could think to explain it.
Park
Once it started to get dark, he felt like his parents
could walk in at any minute, like they should
465/593
have been home a long time ago – and he didn’t
want them to find him like this, with his knee
between Eleanor’s legs and his hand on her hip
and his mouth as far as it could reach down the
neck of her sweater.
He pulled away from her and tried to think
clearly again. ‘Where are you going?’ she asked.
‘I don’t know. Nowhere … My parents
should be home soon, we should get it together.’
‘Okay,’ she said, and sat up. But she looked
so bewildered and beautiful that he climbed back
on top of her and pushed her all the way down.
A half-hour later, he tried again. He stood up
this time.
‘I’m going to the bathroom,’ he said.
‘Go,’ she said. ‘Don’t look back.’
He took a step, then looked back.
‘I’ll go,’ she said a few minutes later.
While she was gone, Park turned up the
volume on the TV. He got them both Cokes and
looked at the couch to see if it looked illicit. It
didn’t seem to.
466/593
When Eleanor came back, her face was wet.
‘Did you wash your face?’
‘Yeah …’ she said.
‘Why?’
‘Because I looked weird.’
‘And you thought you could wash it off?’
He gave her the same once-over he’d given
the couch. Her lips were swollen, and her eyes
seemed wilder than usual. But Eleanor’s sweaters
were always stretched out, and her hair always
looked tangled.
‘You look fine,’ he said. ‘What about me?’
She looked at him, and then smiled. ‘Good
…’ she said. ‘Just really, really good.’
He held out his hand to her, and pulled her
onto the couch. Smoothly, this time.
She sat next to him and looked down at her
lap.
Park leaned against her. ‘It’s not going to be
weird now,’ he said, softly, ‘is it?’
She shook her head and laughed. ‘No,’ she
said, and then, ‘only for a minute, only a little.’
467/593
He’d never seen her face so open. Her brows
weren’t pulled together, her nose wasn’t
scrunched. He put his arm around her, and she
laid her head on his chest without any prompting.
‘Oh, look,’ she said, ‘The Young Ones.’
‘Yeah … Hey. You still haven’t told me –
what was going on yesterday? When I saw you?
What was wrong?’
She sighed. ‘I was on my way to Mrs
Dunne’s office because somebody in gym took
my clothes.’
‘Tina?’
‘I don’t know, probably.’
‘Jesus …’ he said, ‘that’s terrible.’
‘It’s okay.’ She actually sounded like it was.
‘Did you find them? Your clothes?’
‘Yeah … I really, really don’t want to talk
about it.’
‘Okay,’ he said.
Eleanor pressed her cheek into his chest, and
Park hugged her. He wished that they could go
468/593
through life like this. That he could physically
put himself between Eleanor and the world.
Maybe Tina really was a monster.
‘Park?’ Eleanor said. ‘Just one more thing. I
mean, can I ask you something?’
‘You know you can ask me anything. We’ve
got a deal.’
She set her hand over his heart. ‘Did … the
way you acted today have something to do with
seeing me yesterday?’
He almost didn’t want to answer. Yesterday’s
confusing lust felt even more inappropriate now
that he knew the upsetting backstory. ‘Yeah,’ he
said quietly.
Eleanor didn’t say anything for a minute or
so. And then …
‘Tina would be so pissed.’
Eleanor
When Park’s parents got home, they seemed
genuinely glad to see Eleanor. His dad had
469/593
bought a new hunting rifle at the boat show, and
he tried to show her how it worked.
‘You can buy guns at a boat show?’ Eleanor
asked.
‘You can buy anything at a boat show,’ his
dad said. ‘Anything worth having.’
‘Books?’ she asked.
‘Books about guns and boats.’
She stayed late because it was Saturday, and
on the way home she and Park stopped at his
grandparents’ driveway, as usual.
But tonight Park didn’t lean over and kiss
her. Instead, he held her tight.
‘Do you think we’ll ever be alone like that
again?’ she asked. She felt the tears in her eyes.
‘Ever? Yes. Soon? I don’t know …’
She hugged him as hard as she could, and
then she walked home alone.
Richie was home and awake and watching
Saturday Night Live. Ben was asleep on the floor,
and Maisie was sleeping next to Richie on the
couch.
470/593
Eleanor would have gone straight to bed, but
she had to go to the bathroom. Which meant
walking between him and the TV. Twice.
When she got to the bathroom, she pulled her
hair back tight and washed her face again. She
hurried back past the TV without looking up.
‘Where have you been?’ Richie asked.
‘Where do you go all the time?’
‘To my friend’s house,’ Eleanor said. She
kept walking.
‘What friend?’
‘Tina,’ Eleanor said. She put her hand on the
bedroom door.
‘Tina,’ Richie said. There was a cigarette in
his mouth, and he was holding a can of Old Milwaukee.
‘Tina’s house must be fucking Disneyland,
huh? You can’t get enough.’
She waited.
‘Eleanor?’ she heard her mom calling from
the bedroom. She sounded half asleep.
471/593
‘So, what’d you spend your Christmas money
on?’ Richie asked. ‘I told you to buy yourself
something nice.’
The bedroom door opened, and her mother
came out. She was wearing Richie’s bathrobe –
one of those Asian souvenir robes, red satin, with
a big gaudy tiger.
‘Eleanor,’ her mom said, ‘go to bed.’
‘I was just asking Eleanor what she bought
with her Christmas money,’ Richie said.
If Eleanor made something up now, he’d
want to see whatever it was. If she said she
hadn’t spent the money, he might want it back.
‘A necklace,’ she said.
‘A necklace,’ he repeated. He looked at her
blearily, like he was trying to come up with
something awful to say, but he just took another
drink and leaned back in his chair.
‘Good night, Eleanor,’ her mom said.
472/593
CHAPTER 43
Park
Park’s parents almost never fought, and when
they did, it was always about him or Josh.
His parents had been arguing in their bedroom
for more than an hour, and when it was
time to leave for Sunday dinner, their mom came
out and told the boys to go ahead without them.
‘Tell Grandma I have headache.’
‘What did you do?’ Josh asked Park as they
cut through the front lawn.
‘Nothing,’ Park said. ‘What did you do?’
‘Nothing. It’s you. When I went to the bathroom,
I heard mom say your name.’
But Park hadn’t done anything. Not since the
eyeliner – which he knew wasn’t dead, but it
seemed in remission. Maybe his parents knew
somehow about yesterday …
Even if they did, Park hadn’t done anything
with Eleanor that he’d ever been explicitly told
not to do. His mom never talked to him about
that kind of thing. And his dad hadn’t said anything
more than ‘Don’t get anybody pregnant’
since he told Park about sex in the fifth grade.
(He’d told Josh at the same time, which was
insulting.)
Anyway, they hadn’t gone that far. He hadn’t
touched her anywhere that you couldn’t show on
television. Even though he’d wanted to.
He wished now that he had. It might be
months before they were alone again.
Eleanor
She went to Mrs Dunne’s office Monday morning
before class, and Mrs Dunne gave her a brand
new combination lock. It was hot pink.
474/593
‘We talked to some of the girls in your class,’
Mrs Dunne said, ‘but they all played dumb.
We’re still going to get to the bottom of this, I
promise.’
There is no bottom, Eleanor thought. There’s
just Tina.
‘It’s okay,’ she told Mrs Dunne. ‘It doesn’t
matter.’
Tina had watched Eleanor get on the bus that
morning with her tongue on her top lip, like she
was waiting for Eleanor to spaz out – or like she
was trying to see whether Eleanor was wearing
any toilet clothes. But Park was right there, practically
pulling Eleanor into his lap – so it was
easy to ignore Tina and everybody else. He
looked so cute this morning. Instead of his usual
scary black band T-shirt, he was wearing a green
shirt that said ‘Kiss Me, I’m Irish.’
He walked with her to the counselors’ office,
and told her that if anybody stole her clothes
today, she was to find him, immediately.
Nobody did.
475/593
Beebi and DeNice had already heard about
what happened from somebody in another class –
which meant that the whole school knew. They
said they were never going to let Eleanor walk
alone to lunch again, Macho Nachos be damned.
‘Those skanks need to know you have
friends,’ DeNice said.
‘Mmm-hmm,’ Beebi agreed.
Park
His mom was waiting in the Impala Monday afternoon
when Park and Eleanor got off the bus.
She rolled down the window.
‘Hi, Eleanor, sorry, but Park has errand to
run. We see you tomorrow, okay?’
Sure,’ Eleanor said. She looked at him, and
he reached out to squeeze her hand as she walked
away.
He got into the car. ‘Come on, come on,’ his
mom said, ‘why you do everything so slow?
Here.’ She handed him a brochure. State of
476/593
Nebraska Driver’s Manual. ‘Practice test at end,’
she said, ‘now buckle up.’
‘Where are we going?’ he asked.
‘To get your driving license, dummy.’
‘Does Dad know?’
His mom sat on a pillow when she drove and
hung forward on the steering wheel. ‘He knows,
but you don’t have to talk to him about it, okay?
This is our business right now, you and me. Now,
look at test. Not hard. I pass on first try.’
Park flipped to the back of the book and
looked at the practice exam. He’d studied the
whole manual when he turned fifteen and got his
learner’s permit.
‘Is Dad going to be mad at me?’ he asked.
‘Whose business is this right now?’
‘Ours,’ he said.
‘You and me,’ she said.
Park passed the test on his first try. He even parallel
parked the Impala, which was like parallel
parking a Star Destroyer. His mom wiped his
477/593
eyelids with a Kleenex before he had his picture
taken.
She let him drive home. ‘So, if we don’t tell
Dad,’ Park asked, ‘does that mean I can’t ever
drive?’ He wanted to drive Eleanor somewhere.
Anywhere.
‘I work on it,’ his mom said. ‘Meantime, you
have your license if you need it. For emergency.’
That seemed like a pretty weak excuse to get
his license. Park had gone sixteen years without a
driving emergency.
The next morning on the bus, Eleanor asked him
what his big secret errand was, and he handed her
his license.
‘What?’ she said. ‘Look at you, look at this!’
She didn’t want to give it back.
‘I don’t have any pictures of you,’ she said.
‘I’ll get you another one,’ he said.
‘You will? Really?’
‘You can have one of my school pictures. My
mom has tons.’
478/593
‘You have to write something on the back,’
she said.
‘Like what?’
‘Like, “Hey, Eleanor, KIT, LYLAS, stay
sweet, Park.”’
‘But I don’t L-Y like an S,’ he said. ‘And
you’re not sweet.’
‘I’m sweet,’ she said, affronted, holding back
his license.
‘No … you’re other good things,’ he said,
snatching it from her, ‘but not sweet.’
‘Is this where you tell me that I’m a scoundrel,
and I say that I think you like me because
I’m a scoundrel? Because we’ve already covered
this, I’m the Han Solo.’
‘I’m going to write, “For Eleanor, I love you.
Park.”’
‘God, don’t write that, my mom might find
it.’
Eleanor
479/593
Park gave her a school picture. It was from October,
but he already looked so different now.
Older. In the end, Eleanor hadn’t let him write
anything on the back because she didn’t want
him to ruin it.
They hung out in his bedroom after dinner
(Tater Tot casserole) and managed to sneak
kisses while they looked through all of Park’s old
school pictures. Seeing him as a little kid just
made her want to kiss him more. (Gross, but
whatever. As long as she didn’t want to kiss actual
little kids, she wasn’t going to worry about it.)
When Park asked her for a picture, she was
relieved that she didn’t have any to give him.
‘We’ll take one,’ he said.
‘Um … okay.’
‘Okay, cool, I’ll get my mom’s camera.’
‘Now?’
‘Why not now?’
She didn’t have an answer.
His mom was thrilled to take her picture. This
called for Makeover, Part II – which Park cut
480/593
short, thank God, saying, ‘Mom, I want a photo
that actually looks like Eleanor.’
His mom insisted on taking one of them together,
too, which Park didn’t mind at all. He put
his arm around her.
‘Shouldn’t we wait?’ Eleanor asked. ‘For a
holiday or something more memorable?’
‘I want to remember tonight,’ Park said.
He was such a dork sometimes.
Eleanor must have been acting too happy when
she got home because her mom followed her to
the back of the house like she could smell it on
her. (Happiness smelled like Park’s house. Like
Skin So Soft and all four food groups.)
‘Are you going to take a bath?’ her mom
asked.
‘Uh-huh.’
‘I’ll watch the door for you.’
Eleanor turned on the hot water and climbed
into the empty bath tub. It was so cold by the
back door that the bath water started cooling off
481/593
before the tub was even full. Eleanor took baths
in such a hurry she was usually done by then.
‘I ran into Eileen Benson at the store today,’
her mom said. ‘Do you remember her from
church?’
‘I don’t think so,’ Eleanor said. Her family
hadn’t gone to church in three years.
‘She had a daughter your age – Tracy.’
‘Maybe …’
‘Well, she’s pregnant,’ her mom said. ‘And
Eileen’s a wreck. Tracy got involved with a boy
in their neighborhood, a black boy. Eileen’s husband
is having a fit.’
‘I don’t remember them,’ Eleanor said. The
tub was almost full enough to rinse her hair.
‘Well, it just made me think about how lucky
I am,’ her mom said.
‘That you didn’t get involved with a black
guy?’
‘No,’ her mom said. ‘I’m talking about you.
How lucky I am that you’re so smart about boys.’
482/593
‘I’m not smart about boys,’ Eleanor said. She
rinsed her hair quickly, then stood up, covering
herself with a towel while she got dressed.
‘You’ve stayed away from them. That’s
smart.’
Eleanor pulled out the drain and carefully
picked up her dirty clothes. Park’s photo was in
her back pocket, and she didn’t want it to get wet.
Her mom was standing by the stove, watching
her.
‘Smarter than I ever was,’ her mom said.
‘And braver. I haven’t been on my own since the
eighth grade.’
Eleanor hugged her dirty jeans to her chest.
‘You act like there are two kinds of girls,’ she
said. ‘The smart ones and the ones that boys
like.’
‘That’s not far from the truth,’ her mom said,
trying to put her hand on Eleanor’s shoulder.
Eleanor took a step back. ‘You’ll see,’ her mom
said. ‘Wait until you’re older.’
483/593
They both heard Richie’s truck pull into the
driveway.
Eleanor pushed past her mother and rushed to
her bedroom. Ben and Mouse slipped in just behind
her.
Eleanor couldn’t think of a place safe enough for
Park’s photo, so she zipped it into the pocket of
her school bag. After she’d looked at it again and
again and again.
484/593
CHAPTER 44
Eleanor
Wednesday night wasn’t the worst.
Park had taekwando, but Eleanor still had
Park, the memory of him, everywhere. (Everywhere
he’d touched her felt untouchable. Everywhere
he’d touched her felt safe.)
Richie had to work late that night, so her
mom made Totino’s Party Pizzas for dinner.
They must have been on sale at Food 4 Less, because
the freezer was stuffed with them.
They watched Highway to Heaven while they
ate. Then Eleanor sat with Maisie on the living
room floor, and they tried to teach Mouse ‘Down
Down Baby.’
It was hopeless. He could either remember
the words or the clapping, but never both at once.
It drove Maisie crazy. ‘Start again,’ she kept
saying.
‘Come help us, Ben,’ Eleanor said, ‘it’s easier
with four.’
Down, down, baby, down by the roller
coaster.
Sweet, sweet, baby, I’ll never let you go.
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff, shimmy . . .
‘Oh my God, Mouse. Right hand first – right
first. Okay. Start again …’
Down, down, baby . . .
‘Mouse!’
486/593
CHAPTER 45
Park
‘I don’t feel like cooking dinner,’ his mom said.
It was just the three of them, Park, his mom
and Eleanor, sitting on the couch, watching
Wheel of Fortune. His dad had gone turkey hunting
and wouldn’t be home until late, and Josh
was staying over at a friend’s.
‘I could heat up a pizza,’ Park said.
‘Or we could go get pizza,’ his mom said.
Park looked at Eleanor; he didn’t know what
the rules were, as far as going out. Her eyes got
big, and she shrugged.
‘Yeah,’ Park said, grinning, ‘let’s go get
pizza.’
‘I feel too lazy,’ his mom said. ‘You and
Eleanor go get pizza.’
‘You want me to drive?’
‘Sure,’ his mom said. ‘You too scared?’
Jeez, now his mom was calling him a pussy.
‘No, I can drive. Do you want Pizza Hut?
Should we call it in first?’
‘You go where you want,’ his mom said. ‘I’m
not even very hungry. You go. Eat dinner. See
movie or something.’
He and Eleanor both stared at her.
‘Are you sure?’ he asked.
‘Yeah, go,’ she said, ‘I never get house to
myself.’
She was home all day, every day by herself,
but Park decided not to mention it. He and Eleanor
stood up cautiously from the couch. Like they
were expecting his mom to say ‘April fools!’ two
weeks late.
‘Keys on hook,’ she said. ‘Hand me my
purse.’ She gave him twenty dollars from her
wallet, and then ten more.
‘Thanks …’ Park said, still hesitant. ‘I guess
we’ll go now?’
488/593
‘Not yet …’ His mom looked at Eleanor’s
clothes and frowned. ‘Eleanor can’t go out like
that.’ If they wore the same size, she’d be forcing
Eleanor into a stonewashed miniskirt about now.
‘But I’ve looked like this all day,’ Eleanor
said. She was wearing army surplus pants and a
short-sleeved men’s shirt over some kind of longsleeved
purple T-shirt. Park thought she looked
cool. (He actually thought she looked adorable,
but that word would make Eleanor gag.)
‘Just let me fix your hair,’ his mom said. She
pulled Eleanor into the bathroom and started
pulling bobby pins out of her hair. ‘Down, down,
down,’ she said.
Park leaned against the doorway and
watched.
‘It’s weird that you’re watching this,’ Eleanor
said.
‘It’s nothing I haven’t seen before,’ he said.
‘Park probably help me do your hair on wedding
day,’ his mom said.
489/593
He and Eleanor both looked at the floor. ‘I’ll
wait for you in the living room,’ he said.
In a few minutes, she was ready. Her hair
looked perfect, every curl shiny and on purpose,
and her lips were a glossy pink. He could tell
from here that she’d taste like strawberries.
‘Okay,’ his mom said, ‘go. Have fun.’
They walked out to the Impala, and Park
opened the door for Eleanor. ‘I can open my own
door,’ she said. And by the time he got to his
side, she’d leaned over the seat and pushed his
door open.
‘Where should we go?’ he asked.
‘I don’t know,’ she said, sinking down in her
seat. ‘Can we just get out of the neighborhood? I
feel like I’m sneaking across the Berlin Wall.’
‘Oh,’ he said, ‘yeah.’ He started the car and
looked over at her. ‘Get down more. Your hair
glows in the dark.’
‘Thanks.’
‘You know what I mean.’
490/593
He started driving west. There was nothing
east of the Flats but the river.
‘Don’t drive by the Rail,’ she said.
‘The what?’
‘Turn right here.’
‘Okay …’
He looked down at her – she was crouching
on the floor – and laughed.
‘It’s not funny.’
‘It’s kind of funny,’ he said. ‘You’re on the
floor, and I’m only getting to drive because my
dad’s out of town.’
‘Your dad wants you to drive. All you have to
do is learn how to drive a stick.’
‘I already know how to drive a stick.’
‘Then what’s the problem?’
‘The problem is me,’ he said, feeling irritated.
‘Hey, we’re out of the neighborhood, can you sit
up now?’
‘I’ll sit up when we get to Twenty-fourth
Street.’
491/593
She sat up at 24th Street, but they didn’t talk
again until 42nd.
‘Where are we going?’ she asked.
‘I don’t know,’ he said. He really didn’t. He
knew how to get to school and how to get downtown,
and that was it. ‘Where do you want to
go?’
‘I don’t know,’ she said.
Eleanor
She wanted to go to Inspiration Point. Which, as
far as she knew, only existed on Happy Days.
And she didn’t want to say to Park, ‘Hey,
where do you kids go when you want to fog up
the windows?’ Because, what would he think of
her? And what if he had an answer?
Eleanor was trying really hard not be overawed
by Park’s driving skills, but every time he
changed lanes or checked the rearview mirror,
she caught herself swooning. He might as well be
492/593
lighting a cigarette or ordering a Scotch on the
rocks, it made him seem so much older …
Eleanor didn’t have her learner’s permit. Her
mom wasn’t even allowed to drive, so getting
Eleanor’s license wasn’t a priority.
‘Do we have to go somewhere?’ she asked.
‘Well, we have to go somewhere …’ Park
said.
‘But do we have to do something?’
‘What do you mean?’
‘Can’t we just go somewhere and be together?
Where do people go to be together? I don’t
even care if we get out of the car …’
He looked over at her, then looked back,
nervously, at the road. ‘Okay,’ he said. ‘Yeah.
Yeah, just let me …’
He pulled into a parking lot and turned
around.
‘We’ll go downtown.’
Park
493/593
They did get out of the car. Once they were
downtown, Park wanted to show Eleanor Drastic
Plastic and the Antiquarium and all the other record
stores. She’d never even been to the Old
Market, which was practically the only place to
go in Omaha.
There were a bunch of other kids hanging out
downtown, a lot of them looking much weirder
than Eleanor. Park took her to his favorite pizza
place. And then his favorite ice cream place. And
his third favorite comic book shop.
He kept pretending that they were on a real
date, and then he’d remember that they were.
Eleanor
Park held her hand the whole night, like he was
her boyfriend. Because he is your boyfriend,
dummy, she kept telling herself.
Much to the dismay of the girl working at the
record store. She had eight holes in each ear, and
she clearly thought Park was a whole closet full
494/593
of cat’s pajamas. The girl looked at Eleanor like,
are you kidding me? And Eleanor looked back
like, I know, right?
They walked down every street of the Market
area, and then across the street, into a park.
Eleanor didn’t even know all this existed. She
hadn’t realized Omaha could be such a nice place
to live. (In her head, this was Park’s doing, too.
The world rebuilt itself into a better place around
him.)
Park
They ended up at Central Park. Omaha’s version.
Eleanor had never been here before either, and
even though it was wet and muddy and still kind
of cold, she kept saying how nice it was.
‘Oh, look,’ she said. ‘Swans.’
‘I think those are geese,’ he said.
‘Well, they’re the best-looking geese I’ve
ever seen.’
495/593
They sat on one of the park benches and
watched the geese settle in on the bank of the
manmade lake. Park put his arm around Eleanor
and felt her lean against him.
‘Let’s keep doing this,’ he said.
‘What?’
‘Going out.’
‘Okay,’ she said. She didn’t say anything
about him learning how to drive a manual transmission.
Which he appreciated.
‘We should go to prom,’ he said.
‘What?’ She lifted up her head.
‘Prom. You know, prom.’
‘I know what it is, but why would we go
there?’
Because he wanted to see Eleanor in a pretty
dress. Because he wanted to help his mom do her
hair.
‘Because it’s prom,’ he said.
‘And it’s lame,’ she said.
‘How do you know?’
496/593
‘Because the theme is “I Want to Know What
Love Is.”
‘That’s not such a bad song,’ he said.
‘Are you drunk, it’s Foreigner.’
Park shrugged and pulled one of her curls
straight. ‘I know that prom is lame,’ he said. ‘But
it’s not something you can go back and do. You
only get one chance.’
‘Actually, you get three chances …’
‘Okay, will you go to prom with me next
year?’
She started laughing. ‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘sure.
We can go next year. That will give my mouse
and bird friends plenty of time to make me a
dress. Totally. Yes. Let’s go to prom.’
‘You think it’s never going to happen,’ he
said. ‘You’ll see. I’m not going anywhere.’
‘Not until you learn how to drive a stick.’
She was relentless.
Eleanor
497/593
Prom. Right. That was going to happen.
The amount of chicanery it would take to slip
prom past her mother … it boggled the mind.
Though now that Park had suggested it,
Eleanor could almost see it working. She could
tell her mom that she was going to prom with
Tina. (Good old Tina.) And she could get ready
at Park’s house, his mom would love that. The
only thing Eleanor would have to figure out was
the dress …
Did they even make prom dresses in her size?
She’d have to shop in the mother-of-the-bride
section. And she’d have to rob a bank. Seriously.
Even if a hundred-dollar bill fell right out of the
sky, Eleanor could never spend it on something
as stupid as a prom dress.
She’d spend it on new Vans. Or a decent bra.
Or a boom box …
Actually, she’d probably just give it to her
mom.
Prom. As if.
498/593
Park
After she’d agreed to go to next year’s prom with
him, Eleanor also agreed to accompany Park to
his first cotillion, the Academy Awards afterparty,
and any and all ‘balls’ to which he received
invitations.
She giggled so much, the geese complained.
‘Go on and honk,’ Eleanor said. ‘You think
you can intimidate me with your swanlike good
looks, but I’m not that kind of girl.’
‘Lucky for me,’ Park said.
‘Why is that lucky for you?’
‘Never mind.’ He wished he hadn’t said it.
He’d meant to be funny and self-deprecating, but
he didn’t actually want to talk about how she
managed to be attracted to him.
Eleanor was studying him coolly.
‘You’re the reason that goose thinks I’m shallow,’
she said.
‘I think it’s a gander, right?’ Park said. ‘The
males are ganders?’
499/593
‘Oh, right, gander. That suits him. Pretty boy
… So, why is that lucky for you?’
‘Because,’ he said, like both syllables hurt.
‘Because, why?’ she asked.
‘Isn’t that my line?’
‘I thought I could you ask you anything …’
she said. ‘Because, why?’
‘Because of my all-American good looks.’
He ran his hand through his hair and looked
down at the mud.
‘Are you saying that you’re not good-looking?’
she asked.
‘I don’t want to talk about this,’ Park said,
hanging onto the back of his neck. ‘Can we go
back to talking about prom?
‘Are you saying it just so that I’ll tell you
how cute you are?’
‘No,’ he said. ‘I’m saying it because it’s kind
of obvious.’
‘It’s not obvious,’ Eleanor said. She turned
on the bench so she was facing him, and pulled
his hand down.
500/593
‘Nobody thinks Asian guys are hot,’ Park
said finally. He had to look away from her when
he said it – way away, he turned his head completely.
‘Not here, anyway. I assume Asian guys
do all right in Asia.’
‘That’s not true,’ Eleanor argued. ‘Look at
your mom and dad …’
‘Asian girls are different. White guys think
they’re exotic.’
‘But …’
‘Are you trying to come up with a super-hot
Asian guy, so you can prove me wrong? Because
there aren’t any. I’ve had my whole life to think
about this.’
Eleanor folded her arms. Park looked out at
the lake.
‘What about that old TV show,’ she said,
‘with the karate guy?’
‘Kung Fu?’
‘Yeah.’
‘That actor was white, and that character was
a monk.’
501/593
‘What about …’
‘There aren’t any,’ Park said. ‘Look at
M*A*S*H. The whole show takes place in Korea,
and the doctors are always flirting with Korean
girls, right? But the nurses don’t use their R&R
to go to Seoul to pick up hot Korean guys.
Everything that makes Asian girls seem exotic
makes Asian guys seem like girls.’
The gander was still honking at them. Park
picked up a chunk of melting snow and tossed it
half-heartedly in the goose’s direction. He still
couldn’t look at Eleanor.
‘I don’t know what any of that has to do with
me,’ she said.
‘It has everything to do with me,’ he
answered.
‘No.’ She put her hand on his chin and made
him face her. ‘It doesn’t … I don’t even know
what it means that you’re Korean.’
‘Beyond the obvious?’
‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘exactly. Beyond the
obvious.’
502/593
Then she kissed him. He loved it when she
kissed him first.
‘When I look at you,’ she said, leaning into
him, ‘I don’t know if I’m thinking you’re cute
because you’re Korean, but I don’t think it’s in
spite of it. I just know that I think you’re cute.
Like, so cute, Park …’
He loved it when she said his name.
‘Maybe I’m really attracted to Korean guys,’
she said, ‘and I don’t even know it.’
‘Good thing I’m the only Korean guy in
Omaha,’ he said.
‘And good thing I’m never getting out of this
dump.’
It was getting cold, and probably late; Park
wasn’t wearing a watch.
He stood up and pulled Eleanor to her feet.
They held hands and cut through the park to get
to the car.
‘I don’t even know what it means to be
Korean,’ he said.
503/593
‘Well, I don’t know what it means to be Danish
and Scottish,’ she said. ‘Does it matter?’
‘I think so,’ he said, ‘because it’s the numberone
thing people use to identify me. It’s my main
thing.’
‘I’m telling you,’ she said, ‘I think your main
thing might be that you’re cute. You’re practically
adorable.’
Park didn’t mind the word adorable.
Eleanor
They’d parked on the far side of the Market, and
the lot was mostly empty by the time they got
back. Eleanor felt tense and reckless again.
Maybe it was something about this car …
The Impala might not look pervy on the outside,
not like a fully carpeted custom van or
something – but the inside was a different story.
The front seat was almost as big as Eleanor’s
bed, and the back seat was an Erica Jong novel
just waiting to happen.
504/593
Park opened the door for her, then ran around
the car to get in. ‘It’s not as late as I thought,’ he
said, looking at the clock on the dash. 8:30.
‘Yeah …’ she said. She put her hand down on
the seat between them. She tried to do it casually,
but it came off pretty obvious.
Park laid his hand on top of hers.
It was just that kind of night. Every time she
looked at him, he was looking back at her. Every
time she thought about kissing him, he was
already closing his eyes.
Read my mind now, she thought.
‘Are you hungry?’ he asked.
‘No,’ she said.
‘Okay.’ Park took his hand away and put the
key in the ignition. Eleanor reached up and
caught his sleeve before he could turn it.
He dropped the keys and, all in one motion,
he turned and scooped her into his arms. Seriously,
scooped. He was always stronger than she
expected him to be.
505/593
If you were watching them now (and you
totally could because the windows weren’t
fogged over yet) you’d think that Eleanor and
Park did this kind of thing all the time. Not just
the once before.
This time was already different.
They weren’t moving forward in orderly
steps, like a game of Mother May I? They weren’t
even kissing each other square on the mouth.
(Lining things up neatly would take too long.)
Eleanor climbed up his shirt, climbing on top of
him. And Park kept pulling her to him, even
when she couldn’t come any closer.
She was wedged between Park and the steering
wheel, and when he pushed his hand up her
shirt, she leaned against the horn. They both
jumped, and Park accidentally bit her tongue.
‘Are you okay?’ he asked.
‘Yeah,’ she said, glad that he didn’t pull his
hand away. Her tongue didn’t seem to be bleeding.
‘You?’
506/593
‘Yeah …’ He was breathing heavy, and it
was wonderful. I did this to him, she told herself.
‘Do you think …’ he said.
‘What?’ He probably thought they should
stop. No, she thought, no, I don’t think. Don’t
think, Park.
‘Do you think we should … don’t think I’m a
creep, okay? Do you think we should get in the
back seat?’
She pushed off of him and slid over the back
seat. God, it was huge, it was glorious.
Not even a second later, Park landed on top
of her.
Park
She felt so good underneath, even better than
he’d expected. (And he’d expected her to feel
like heaven, plus nirvana, plus that scene in Willy
Wonka where Charlie starts to fly.) Park was
breathing so hard, he couldn’t get any air.
507/593
It seemed impossible that this could feel as
good to Eleanor as it did to him – but she was
making these faces … She looked like a girl in a
Prince video. If Eleanor was feeling anything like
what he was feeling, how were they ever supposed
to stop?
He pulled her shirt up over her head.
‘Bruce Lee,’ she whispered.
‘What?’ That didn’t seem right. Park’s hands
froze.
‘Super-hot Asian guy. Bruce Lee.’
‘Oh …’ He laughed, he couldn’t help it.
‘Okay. I’ll give you Bruce Lee …’
She arched her back and he closed his eyes.
He’d never get enough of her.
508/593
CHAPTER 46
Eleanor
Richie’s truck was in the driveway, but the whole
house was dark, thank God. Eleanor was sure that
something would give her away. Her hair. Her
shirt. Her mouth. She felt radioactive.
She and Park had been sitting in the alley for
a while, in the front seat, just holding hands and
feeling whiplashed. At least, that’s how Eleanor
felt. It wasn’t that she and Park had gone too far,
necessarily – but they’d gone a whole lot farther
than she’d been prepared for. She’d never expected
to have a love scene straight out of a Judy
Blume book.
Park must be feeling strange, too. He sat
through two Bon Jovi songs without even
touching the radio. Eleanor had left a mark on his
shoulder, but you couldn’t see it anymore.
This was her mom’s fault.
If Eleanor were allowed to have normal relationships
with boys, she wouldn’t have felt like
she had to hit a home run the very first time she
ended up in the back seat of a car – she wouldn’t
have felt like it might be her only time at bat.
(And she wouldn’t be making these stupid baseball
metaphors.)
It hadn’t been a home run, anyway. They’d
stopped at second base. (At least, she thought it
was second base. She’d heard conflicting definitions
for the bases.) Still …
It was wonderful.
So wonderful that she wasn’t sure how they’d
survive never doing it again.
‘I should go in,’ she said to Park, after they’d
been sitting in the car a half-hour or more. ‘I’m
usually home by now.’
He nodded but didn’t look up or let go of her
hand.
510/593
‘Okay,’ she said. ‘We’re … okay, right?’
He looked up then. His hair had flattened out,
and it fell in his eyes. He looked concerned.
‘Yeah,’ he said. ‘Oh. Yeah. I’m just …’
She waited.
He closed his eyes and shook his head, like
he was embarrassed.
‘I … just really don’t want to say goodbye to
you, Eleanor. Ever.’
He opened his eyes and looked straight into
her. Maybe this was third base.
She swallowed. ‘You don’t have to say goodbye
to me ever,’ she said. ‘Just tonight.’
Park smiled. Then he raised an eyebrow.
Eleanor wished she could do that.
‘Tonight …’ he said, ‘but not ever?’
She rolled her eyes. She was talking like him
now. Like an idiot. She hoped it was too dark in
the alley for him to see her blush.
‘Goodbye,’ she said, shaking her head. ‘I’ll
see you tomorrow.’ She opened the door to the
Impala; it weighed as much as a horse. Then she
511/593
stopped and looked back at him. ‘But we’re okay,
right?’
‘We’re perfect,’ he said, leaning forward
quickly and kissing her cheek. ‘I’ll wait for you
to get in.’
As soon as Eleanor slipped in the house, she
could hear them fighting.
Richie was yelling about something, and her
mom was crying. Eleanor moved toward her bedroom
as quietly as she could.
All the little kids were on the floor, even
Maisie. They were sleeping through the chaos. I
wonder how often I sleep through it. Eleanor
thought. She managed to swing onto her bed
without stepping on anybody, but she landed on
the cat. He squawked, and she pulled him up and
onto her lap. ‘Shhh,’ she breathed, scratching his
neck.
Richie shouted again – ‘my house’– and
Eleanor and the cat both jumped. Something
crunched beneath her.
512/593
She reached under her leg and pulled out a
badly crumpled comic book. An X-Men annual.
Damn it, Ben. She tried to smooth the comic out
on her lap, but it was covered in some goop. The
blanket felt wet, too, it was lotion or something
… No, liquid makeup. With little bits of broken
glass. Eleanor carefully picked a shard out of the
cat’s tail and set it aside, then wiped her wet fingers
on his fur. A length of oily-brown cassette
tape was wrapped around his leg. Eleanor pulled
it free. She looked down the bed and blinked until
her eyes adjusted to the dark …
Torn comic book pages.
Powder.
Little pools of green eyeshadow …
Miles of cassette tape.
Her headphones were snapped in half and
hanging from the edge of the bunk. Her
grapefruit box was at the end of the bed, and
Eleanor knew before she reached for it that it
would be light as air. Empty. The lid was ripped
almost in half, and someone had written on it in
513/593
bold black marker – with one of Eleanor’s
markers.
do you think you can make a fool of me?
this is my house do you think you can hore
around my neighborhood right under my
nose and i’m not going to find out is that
what you think? i know what you are and its
over’
Eleanor stared at the lid and struggled to make
the letters into words – but she couldn’t get past
the familiar spill of lowercase letters.
Somewhere in the house her mother was crying
like she was never going to stop.
514/593
CHAPTER 47
Eleanor
Eleanor considered her options.
1.
CHAPTER 48
Eleanor
do i make you wet?
She pulled back the soiled blanket and set the
cat on the clean sheet underneath. Then she
climbed from the top bunk to the bottom. Her
bookbag was sitting by the door. Eleanor unzipped
it without getting off the bed and took
Park’s photo out of the side pocket. Then she was
out the window and on the porch and running
down the street faster than she’d ever run in gym
class.
She didn’t slow down until she was on the
next block, and then only because she didn’t
know where to go. She was almost to Park’s
house – she couldn’t go to Park’s house.
pop that cherry
‘Hey, Red.’
Eleanor ignored the girl’s voice. She looked
back at the street. What if somebody had heard
her leave the house? What if Richie came after
her? She stepped off the sidewalk into someone’s
yard. Behind a tree.
‘Hey. Eleanor.’
Eleanor looked around. She was standing in
front of Steve’s house. The garage door was
mostly closed, propped open with a baseball bat.
Eleanor could see someone moving inside, and
Tina was walking down the driveway, holding a
beer.
‘Hey,’ Tina hissed. She looked as disgusted
with Eleanor as ever. Eleanor thought about running
again, but her legs felt weak.
‘Your stepdad’s been looking for you,’ Tina
said. ‘He’s been driving around the neighborhood
all goddamn night.’
‘What did you tell him?’ Eleanor said. Did
Tina do this? Is that how he knew?
517/593
‘I asked him if his dick was bigger than his
truck,’ Tina said. ‘I didn’t tell him anything.’
‘Did you tell him about Park?’
Tina narrowed her eyes. Then shook her
head. ‘But somebody’s going to.’
suck me off
Eleanor looked back at the street. She had to
hide. She had to get away from him.
‘What’s wrong with you anyway?’ Tina
asked.
‘Nothing.’ A pair of headlights stopped at the
end of the block. Eleanor put her arms over her
head.
‘Come on,’ Tina said, in a voice Eleanor had
never heard before – concerned. ‘You just need
to stay out of his way until he cools off.’
Eleanor followed Tina up the driveway,
crouching to get into the hazy, dark garage.
‘Is that Big Red?’ Steve was sitting on a
couch. Mikey was there, too, on the floor, with
one of the girls from the bus. There was hessian
518/593
music, Black Sabbath, coming from a car up on
blocks in the middle of the garage.
‘Sit down,’ Tina said, pointing to the other
end of the couch.
‘You’re in trouble, Big Red,’ Steve said.
‘Your daddy’s looking for you.’ Steve was grinning
from ear to ear. His mouth was bigger than a
lion’s.
‘It’s her stepdad,’ Tina said.
‘Stepdad,’ Steve shouted, throwing a beer can
across the garage. ‘Your fucking stepdad? Do
you want me to kill him for you? I’m gonna kill
Tina’s anyway. I could get them both in the same
day. Buy one, get one …’ He giggled. ‘Buy one,
get one … free.’
Tina opened a beer and shoved it into Eleanor’s
lap. Eleanor took it, just to have something
to hold. ‘Drink up,’ Tina said.
Eleanor took a sip obediently. It tasted sharp
and yellow.
519/593
‘We should play quarters,’ Steve slurred.
‘Hey, Red, do you have any quarters?’ Eleanor
shook her head.
Tina perched next to him on the arm of the
couch and lit a cigarette. ‘We had quarters,’ she
said. ‘We spent them on beer, remember?’
‘Those weren’t quarters,’ Steve said. ‘That
was a ten.’
Tina closed her eyes and blew smoke at the
ceiling.
Eleanor closed her eyes, too. She tried to
think about what she should do next, but nothing
came to her. The music on the car radio switched
from Sabbath to ACDC to Zeppelin. Steve sang
along; his voice was surprisingly light. ‘Hangman,
hangman, turn your head a while …’
Eleanor listened to Steve sing song after song
over the wet hammer of her heartbeat. The beer
can went warm in her hand.
i know your a slut you smell like cum
She stood up. ‘I’ve got to get out of here.’
520/593
‘God,’ Tina said, ‘relax. He won’t find you
here. He’s probably already at the Rail drinking it
off.’
‘No,’ Eleanor said. ‘He’s going to kill me.’
It was true, she realized, even if it wasn’t.
Tina’s face was hard. ‘So, where you gonna
go?’
‘Away … I have to tell Park.’
Park
Park couldn’t sleep.
That night, before they’d climbed back into
the front seat of the Impala, he’d taken off all of
Eleanor’s layers and even unpinned her bra –
then laid her down on the blue upholstery. She’d
looked like a vision there, a mermaid. Cool white
in the darkness, the freckles gathered on her
shoulders and cheeks like cream rising to the top.
The sight of her. She still glowed on the inside
of his eyelids.
521/593
It was going to be constant torture now that
he knew what she was like under her clothes –
and there wasn’t a next time in their near future.
Tonight was another fluke, a lucky break, a gift
…
‘Park,’ someone said.
Park sat up in bed and looked around dumbly.
‘Park.’ There was a knock at the window,
and he scrambled over to it, pulling back the
curtain.
It was Steve. Right behind the glass, grinning
like a maniac. He must be hanging from the window
ledge. Steve’s face disappeared, and Park
heard him fall heavily onto the ground. That asshole.
Park’s mom was going to hear him.
Park opened the window quickly and leaned
out. He was going to tell Steve to go away, but
then he saw Eleanor standing in the shadow of
Steve’s house with Tina.
Were they holding her hostage?
Was she holding a beer?
522/593
Eleanor
As soon as Park saw her, he climbed out the window
and hung four feet from the ground – he was
going to break his ankles. Eleanor felt a sob catch
in her throat.
He landed in a crouch like Spider-Man and
ran toward her. She dropped the beer on the
grass.
‘Jesus,’ Tina said. ‘You’re welcome. That
was the last beer.’
‘Hey, Park, did I scare you?’ Steve asked.
‘Did you think I was Freddy Krueger? You think
you was gonna get away from me?’
Park got to Eleanor and took her arms.
‘What’s wrong?’ he asked. ‘What’s going on?’
She started to cry. Like, majorly cry. She felt
like herself again as soon as he touched her, and
it was horrible.
‘Are you bleeding?’ Park asked, taking her
hand.
‘Car,’ Tina whispered.
523/593
Eleanor pulled Park against the garage until
the headlights had passed. ‘What’s going on?’ he
asked again.
‘We should get back to the garage,’ Tina said.
Park
He hadn’t been in Steve’s garage since grade
school. They used to play foosball in here. Now
there was the Camaro up on blocks and an old
couch pushed against the wall.
Steve sat at one end of the couch and immediately
lit a joint. He held it out to Park, but Park
shook his head. The garage already smelled like a
thousand joints had been smoked in here, then
put out in a thousand beers. The Camaro was
rocking a little bit and Steve kicked the door.
‘Settle down, Mikey, you’re gonna knock it
over.’
Park couldn’t even imagine a turn of events
that would have led Eleanor here – but she’d
practically dragged him into the garage, and now
524/593
she was huddled against him. Park still thought
maybe they’d kidnapped her. Was he supposed to
pay ransom?
‘Talk to me,’ he said to the top of Eleanor’s
head. ‘What’s going on?’
‘Her stepdad is looking for her,’ Tina said.
Tina was sitting on the arm of the couch with her
legs in Steve’s lap. She took the joint from him.
‘Is that true?’ Park asked Eleanor. She nodded
into his chest. She wouldn’t let him pull far
enough away that he could look at her.
‘Fucking stepdads,’ Steve said. ‘Motherfuckers,
all of them.’ He burst into laughter. ‘Oh,
fuck, Mikey, did you hear that?’ He kicked the
Camaro again. ‘Mikey?’
‘I have to leave,’ Eleanor whispered.
Thank God. Park backed away from her and
took her hand. ‘Hey, Steve, we’re going back to
my house.’
‘Be careful, man, he’s been driving around in
that shit-colored Micro Machine …’
525/593
Park bent to clear the garage door. Eleanor
stopped behind him. ‘Thank you,’ she said – he
would swear that she was talking to Tina.
This night couldn’t get any weirder.
He led Eleanor through his backyard, then around
the back of his grandparents’ house to the driveway,
past the spot by the garage where they liked
to kiss goodbye.
When they got to the RV, Park reached up
and opened the screen door. ‘Go on,’ he said.
‘It’s always unlocked.’
He and Josh used to play in here. It was like a
little house, with a bed at one end and a kitchen
at the other. There was even a miniature stove
and refrigerator. It had been a while since Park
had been inside the RV – he couldn’t stand up
now without hitting his head on the ceiling.
There was a checkerboard-sized table against
the wall with two seats. Park sat on one side and
sat Eleanor down across from him. He reached
for her hands – her right palm was streaked with
blood, but she didn’t seem to be in pain.
526/593
‘Eleanor …’ he said. ‘What’s going on?’ He
was pleading.
‘I have to leave,’ she said. She was looking
across the table like she’d just seen a ghost. Like
she was one.
‘Why?’ he said. ‘Is this about tonight?’ In
Park’s head, it felt like everything must be about
tonight. Like nothing that good and this bad
could happen on the same night unless they were
related. Whatever this was.
‘No,’ Eleanor said, rubbing her eyes. ‘No. It’s
not about us. I mean …’ She looked out the little
window.
‘Why is your stepdad looking for you?’
‘Because he knows, because I ran away.’
‘Why?’
‘Because he knows.’ Her voice caught. ‘Because
it’s him.’
‘What?’
‘Oh God, I shouldn’t have come here,’ she
said. ‘I’m just making it worse. I’m sorry.’
527/593
Park wanted to shake her, to shake through to
her – she wasn’t making any sense. Two hours
ago, everything had been perfect between them,
and now … Park had to get back to his house.
His mom was still awake, and his dad was going
to be home any minute.
He leaned over the table and took Eleanor by
the shoulders.
‘Could we just start over?’ he whispered.
‘Please? I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
Eleanor closed her eyes and nodded wearily.
She started over.
She told him everything.
And Park’s hands started shaking before she
was halfway through.
‘Maybe he won’t hurt you,’ he said, hoping it
was true, ‘maybe he’s just trying to scare you.
Here …’ He pulled his hand inside his sleeve and
tried to wipe Eleanor’s face.
‘No,’ she said. ‘You don’t know, you don’t
see how … how he looks at me.’
528/593
CHAPTER 49
Eleanor
How he looks at me.
Like he’s biding his time.
Not like he wants me. Like he’ll get around to
me. When there’s nothing and no one else left to
destroy.
How he waits up for me.
Keeps track of me.
How he’s always there. When I’m eating.
When I’m reading. When I’m brushing my hair.
You don’t see.
Because I pretend not to.
CHAPTER 50
Park
Eleanor pushed her curls out of her face one by
one, like she was gathering her wits by hand. ‘I
have to go,’ she said.
She was making more sense now, and more
eye contact, but Park still felt like someone had
turned the world upside down and was shaking it.
‘You could talk to your mom tomorrow,’ he
said. ‘Everything might look different in the
morning.’
‘You saw what he wrote on my books,’ she
said evenly. ‘Would you want me to stay there?’
‘I … I just don’t want you to leave,’ he said.
‘Where would you go? To your dad’s house?’
‘No, he doesn’t want me.’
‘But if you explained …’
‘He doesn’t want me.’
‘Then … where?’
‘I don’t know.’ She took a deep breath and
squared her shoulders. ‘My uncle said I could
spend the summer with him. Maybe he’ll let me
come up to St Paul early.’
‘St Paul, Minnesota.’
She nodded.
‘But …’ Park looked in Eleanor’s eyes, and
her hands fell to the table.
‘I know,’ she sobbed, slumping forward. ‘I
know …’
There was no room to sit at the table next to
her, so he dropped to his knees and pulled her
onto the dusty linoleum floor.
Eleanor
‘When are you leaving?’ he asked. He pushed her
hair out of her face and held it behind her head.
‘Tonight,’ she said, ‘I can’t go home.’
531/593
‘How are you going to get there? Have you
called your uncle?’
‘No. I don’t know. I thought I’d take the bus.’
She was going to hitchhike.
She figured she could walk as far as the Interstate,
then she’d stick out her thumb for station
wagons and minivans. Family cars. If she hadn’t
been raped or murdered – or sold into white
slavery – by Des Moines, she’d call her uncle
collect. He’d come to get her, even if it was just
to bring her home.
‘You can’t take the bus by yourself,’ Park
said.
‘I don’t have a better plan.’
‘I’ll drive you,’ he said.
‘To the bus station?’
‘To Minnesota.’
‘Park, no, your parents will never let you.’
‘So I won’t ask.’
‘But your dad will kill you.’
‘No,’ he said, ‘he’ll ground me.’
‘For life.’
532/593
‘Do you think I even care about that right
now?’ He held her face in his hands. ‘Do you
think I care about anything but you?’
533/593
CHAPTER 51
Eleanor
Park said he’d come back after his dad got home
and his parents were both asleep.
‘It might be a while. Don’t turn on the light
or anything, okay?’
‘Duh.’
‘And watch for the Impala.’
‘Okay.’
He looked more serious than she’d seen him
since the day he kicked Steve’s ass. Or since her
first day on the bus, when he’d ordered her to sit
down. That was still the only time she’d heard
him use the F-word.
He leaned into the RV and touched her chin.
‘Please be careful,’ she said.
And then he was gone.
Eleanor sat back down at the table. She could
see Park’s driveway from there, through the lace
curtains. She felt tired suddenly. She just wanted
to lay her head down. It was already after midnight;
it could be hours before Park came back …
Maybe she should feel bad about involving
him in all this, but she didn’t. He was right, the
worst thing that would happen to him (barring
some terrible accident) was that he’d be grounded.
And being grounded at his house was like
winning the Price is Right showcase compared to
what would happen if Eleanor got caught.
Should she have left a note?
Would her mom call the police? (Was her
mom okay? Were they all okay? Eleanor should
have checked to see if the little kids were
breathing.)
Her uncle probably wouldn’t even let Eleanor
stay once he found out she’d run away …
God, whenever she started to think this plan
through, it all fell apart. But it was already too
late to turn back. It felt like the most important
535/593
thing now was to run, the most important place to
be was away.
She’d get away, and then she’d figure out
what to do next.
Or maybe she wouldn’t …
Maybe she’d get away, and then she’d just
stop.
Eleanor had never thought about killing herself
– ever – but she thought a lot about stopping.
Just running until she couldn’t run anymore.
Jumping from something so high that she’d never
hit the bottom.
Was Richie out looking for her now?
Maisie and Ben would tell him about Park, if
they hadn’t already. Not because they liked Richie,
though sometimes it still seemed like they did.
Because he had them on leashes. Like the first
day Eleanor came to the house, when Maisie was
sitting on Richie’s lap …
Fuck. Just … fuck.
She should go back for Maisie.
536/593
She should go back for all of them – she
should find a way to fit them in her pockets – but
she should definitely go back for Maisie. Maisie
would run away with Eleanor. She wouldn’t
think twice …
And then Uncle Geoff would send them both
right home.
Her mom would definitely call the police if
she woke up and Maisie was gone. Bringing
Maisie would ruin everything even worse than it
was already ruined.
If Eleanor were the hero of some book, like
The Boxcar Children or something, she’d try. If
she were Dicey Tillerman, she’d find a way.
She’d be brave and noble, and she’d find a
way.
But she wasn’t. Eleanor wasn’t any of those
things. She was just trying to get through the
night.
Park
537/593
Park walked quietly into his house through the
back door. Nobody in his family ever locked
anything.
The TV was still on in his parents’ bedroom.
He went straight to the bathroom and into the
shower. He was pretty sure he smelled like every
single thing that could get him in trouble.
‘Park?’ his mom called when he walked out
of the bathroom.
‘Here,’ he said. ‘Just going to bed.’
He buried his dirty clothes at the bottom of
the hamper and dug all his leftover birthday and
Christmas money out of his sock drawer. Sixty
dollars. That should be enough for gas … probably,
he didn’t really know.
If they could just get to St Paul, Eleanor’s
uncle would help them figure it out. She wasn’t
sure her uncle would let her stay, but she said he
was a decent guy, ‘and his wife was in the Peace
Corps.’
Park had already written his parents a note:
Mom and Dad,
538/593
I had to help Eleanor. I’ll call you tomorrow,
and I’ll be back in a day or two. I
know I’m in huge trouble, but this was an
emergency, and I had to help.
Park
His mom always kept her keys in the same place
– on a little key-shaped plaque in the entryway
that said ‘keys.’
Park was going to take her keys, then sneak
back out the kitchen door, the door farthest from
his parents’ room.
His dad got home around 1:30. Park listened
to him move around the kitchen, then the bathroom.
He heard the door to his parents’ room
open, he heard the TV.
Park lay on his bed and closed his eyes.
(There was no chance he’d fall asleep.) The picture
of Eleanor was still glowing on the inside of
his eyelids.
So beautiful. So peaceful … No, that wasn’t
quite right, not peaceful, more like … at peace.
539/593
Like she was more comfortable out of her shirt
than in it. Like she was happy inside out.
When he opened his eyes, he saw her the way
he’d left her in the RV – tense and resigned, so
far gone that light wouldn’t even catch in her
eyes.
So far gone, she wasn’t even thinking about
him anymore.
Park waited until it was quiet. Then he waited another
twenty minutes. Then he grabbed his backpack
and went through the motions he’d planned
in his head.
He stopped at the kitchen door. His dad had
left his new hunting rifle out on the table … He
was probably going to clean it tomorrow morning.
For a minute, Park thought about taking the
gun – but he couldn’t think of when he’d use it.
It’s not like they were going to run into Richie on
the way out of town. Hopefully.
Park opened the door and was about to step
out when his dad’s voice stopped him.
‘Park?’
540/593
He could have run for it, but his dad probably
would’ve caught him. His dad was always bragging
about being in the best shape of his life.
‘Where do you think you’re going?’ his dad
whispered.
‘I … I have to help Eleanor.’
‘What does Eleanor need help with at two in
the morning?’
‘She’s running away.’
‘And you’re going with her?’
‘No. I was just going to give her a ride to her
uncle’s house.’
‘Where does her uncle live?’
‘Minnesota.’
‘Jesus F. Christ, Park,’ his dad said in his normal
voice, ‘are you serious?’
‘Dad.’ Park stepped toward him, pleading.
‘She has to go. It’s her stepdad. He’s …’
‘Did he touch her? Because if he touched her,
we’re calling the police.’
‘He writes her these notes.’
‘What kind of notes?’
541/593
Park rubbed his forehead. He didn’t like to
think about the notes. ‘Sick ones.’
‘Did she talk to her mom?’
‘Her mom’s … not in very good shape. I
think he hurts her.’
‘That little fucker …’ His dad looked down at
the gun, then looked back at Park, rubbing his
chin. ‘So you’re going to drive Eleanor to her
uncle’s house. Will he take her in?’
‘She thinks so.’
‘I gotta tell you, Park, this doesn’t sound like
much of a plan.’
‘I know.’
His dad sighed and scratched the back of his
neck. ‘But I can’t think of a better one.’
Park’s head jerked up.
‘Call me when you get there,’ his dad said
quietly. ‘It’s a straight shot up from Des Moines
– do you have a map?’
‘I thought I’d get one at a gas station.’
542/593
‘If you get tired, pull into a rest stop. And
don’t talk to anybody unless you have to. Do you
have any money?’
‘Sixty dollars.’
‘Here …’ His dad walked over to the cookie
jar and pulled out a bunch of twenties. ‘If this
doesn’t work, with her uncle, don’t take Eleanor
home. Bring her back here, and we’ll figure out
what to do next.’
‘Okay … Thanks, Dad.’
‘Don’t thank me yet. I’ve got one condition.’
No more eyeliner, Park thought.
‘You’re taking the truck,’ his dad said.
His dad stood on the front steps with his arms
folded. Of course he had to watch. Like he was
umpiring a goddamn taekwando bout.
Park closed his eyes. Eleanor was still there.
Eleanor.
He started the engine and shifted smoothly
into reverse, rolled out of the driveway, shifted
into first, then pulled forward without a sputter.
Because he knew how to drive a stick. Jesus.
543/593
CHAPTER 52
Park
‘Okay?’
She nodded and climbed in.
‘Stay down,’ he said.
The first couple hours were a blur.
Park wasn’t used to driving the truck, and it
died a few times at red lights. Then he got on the
Interstate heading west instead of east, and it
took twenty minutes to turn around again.
Eleanor didn’t say anything. Just stared ahead
and held onto her seat belt with both hands. He
put his hand on her leg, and it was like she didn’t
notice it was there.
They got off the Interstate again somewhere
in Iowa to get gas and a map. Park went in. He
bought Eleanor a Coke and a sandwich, and
when he got back to the truck she was slumped
against the passenger door, asleep.
Good, he tried to tell himself. She’s
exhausted.
He climbed up behind the wheel and took a
few rough breaths, then he slammed the sandwich
onto the dash. How could she be asleep?
If everything went right tonight, Park would
be driving home tomorrow morning by himself.
He’d probably be allowed to drive now whenever
he wanted, but there was nowhere he wanted to
go without Eleanor.
How could she sleep through their last hours
together?
How could she sleep sitting up like that …
Her hair was down and wild, wine-red even
in this light, and her mouth was slightly open.
Strawberry girl. He tried again to remember what
he’d thought the first time he saw her. He tried to
remember how this happened – how she went
545/593
from someone he’d never met to the only one
who mattered.
And he wondered … What would happen if
he didn’t take her to her uncle’s house? What
would happen if he kept driving?
Why couldn’t this have waited?
If Eleanor’s life had caved in next year, or the
year after, she could have run to him. Not from,
not away.
Jesus. Why couldn’t she just wake up?
Park stayed awake for another hour or so,
fueled by Coke and hurt feelings. Then the wreck
of the night caught up with him. There wasn’t a
rest stop around, so he pulled off on a county
road, onto the gravel that passed as a shoulder.
He unbuckled his seat belt, unbuckled Eleanor’s,
then pulled her into him, laying his head on
hers. She still smelled like last night. Like sweat
and sweetness and the Impala. He cried into her
hair until he fell asleep.
Eleanor
546/593
She woke up in Park’s arms. It caught her by
surprise.
She would’ve thought it was a dream, but her
dreams were always terrifying. (With Nazis and
babies crying and teeth rotting out of her mouth.)
Eleanor had never dreamed anything as nice as
this, as nice as Park, sleepy-soft and warm …
Warm through. Someday, she thought, somebody’s
going to wake up to this every morning.
Park’s face, asleep, was a brand new kind of
beautiful. Sunshine-trapped-in-amber skin. Full,
flat mouth. Strong, arched cheekbones. (Eleanor
didn’t even have cheekbones.)
He caught her by surprise, and before she
could help herself, her heart was breaking for
him. Like it didn’t have anything better to break
over …
Maybe it didn’t.
The sun was just below the horizon, and the
inside of the truck was bluey pink. Eleanor kissed
Park’s new face – just under his eye, not quite on
his nose. He stirred, and she felt every part of
547/593
him shift against her. She ran the end of her nose
along his brow and kissed his lashes.
His eyelids fluttered. (Only eyelids do that.
And butterflies.) And his arms came to life
around her. ‘Eleanor …’ he sighed.
She held his beautiful face and kissed him
like it was the end of the world.
Park
She wouldn’t be on the bus with him.
She wouldn’t roll her eyes at him in English.
She wouldn’t pick a fight with him just because
she was bored.
She wouldn’t cry in his bedroom about the
things he couldn’t fix for her.
The whole sky was the color of her skin.
Eleanor
There’s only one of him, she thought, and he’s
right here.
548/593
He knows I’ll like a song before I’ve heard it.
He laughs before I even get to the punchline.
There’s a place on his chest, just below his
throat, that makes me want to let him open doors
for me.
There’s only one of him.
Park
His parents never talked about how they met, but
when Park was younger, he used to try to imagine
it.
He loved how much they loved each other. It
was the thing he thought about when he woke up
scared in the middle of the night. Not that they
loved him – they were his parents, they had to
love him. That they loved each other. They didn’t
have to do that.
None of his friend’s parents were still together,
and in every case that seemed like the number
one thing that had gone wrong with his friends’
lives.
549/593
But Park’s parents loved each other. They
kissed each other on the mouth, no matter who
was watching.
What are the chances you’d ever meet
someone like that? he wondered. Someone you
could love forever, someone who would forever
love you back? And what did you do when that
person was born half a world away?
The math seemed impossible. How did his
parents get so lucky?
They couldn’t have felt lucky at the time. His
dad’s brother had just died in Vietnam; that’s
why they sent his dad to Korea. And when his
parents got married, his mom had to leave
everything and everyone she loved behind.
Park wondered if his dad saw his mom in the
street or from the road or working in a restaurant.
He wondered how they both knew …
This kiss had to last Park forever.
It had to get him home.
He needed to remember it when he woke up
scared in the middle of the night.
550/593
Eleanor
The first time he’d held her hand, it felt so good
that it crowded out all the bad things. It felt better
than anything had ever hurt.
Park
Eleanor’s hair caught fire at dawn. Her eyes were
dark and shining, and his arms were sure of her.
The first time he’d touched her hand, he’d
known.
Eleanor
There’s no shame with Park. Nothing is dirty.
Because Park is the sun, and that’s best way she
could think to explain it.
Park
‘Eleanor, no, we have to stop.’
551/593
‘No …’
‘We can’t do this …’
‘No. Don’t stop, Park.’
‘I don’t even know how to … I don’t have
anything.’
‘It doesn’t matter.’
‘But I don’t want you to get …’
‘I don’t care.’
‘I care. Eleanor …’
‘It’s our last chance.’
‘No. No, I can’t … I, no, I need to believe
that it isn’t our last chance … Eleanor? Can you
hear me? I need you to believe it, too.’
552/593
CHAPTER 53
Park
Eleanor got out of the truck, and Park wandered
into the cornfield to pee. (Which was embarrassing,
but less embarrassing than pissing his pants.)
When he came back, she was sitting on the
hood of the truck. She looked beautiful, fierce,
leaning forward like a figurehead.
He climbed up and sat next to her.
‘Hey,’ he said.
‘Hey.’
He pushed his shoulder up against hers and
nearly wept with relief when she laid her head
against him. Weeping again today seemed wholly
inevitable.
‘Do you really believe that?’ she asked.
‘What?’
‘That … we’ll have other chances? That we
have any chance at all?’
‘Yes.’
‘No matter what happens,’ she said forcefully,
‘I’m not coming home.’
‘I know.’
She was quiet.
‘No matter what happens,’ Park said, ‘I love
you.’
She put her arms around his waist, and he
hugged her shoulders.
‘I just can’t believe that life would give us to
each other,’ he said, ‘and then take it back.’
‘I can,’ she said. ‘Life’s a bastard.’
He held her tighter, and pushed his face into
her neck.
‘But it’s up to us …’ he said softly. ‘It’s up to
us not to lose this.’
Eleanor
554/593
She sat right next to him for the rest of the trip –
even though there wasn’t a seat belt, and she had
to sit with the stick shift between her legs. She
figured it was still lots safer than riding in the
back of Richie’s Isuzu.
They stopped at another truck stop and Park
bought her Cherry Coke and beef jerky. He
called his parents collect – she still couldn’t believe
they were okay with this.
‘My dad’s okay,’ he said. ‘I think my mom’s
freaking out.’
‘Have they heard from my mom or …
anybody?’
‘No. Or, at least, they didn’t mention it.’
Park asked her if she wanted to call her uncle.
She didn’t.
‘I smell like Steve’s garage,’ she said. ‘My
uncle’s going to think I’m a drug dealer.’
Park laughed. ‘I think you spilled beer on
your shirt. Maybe he’ll just think you’re an
alcoholic.’
555/593
She looked down at her shirt. There was a
smear of blood from when she’d cut her hand on
her bed – and something crusty on the shoulder,
probably snot from all that crying.
‘Here,’ Park said. He was taking off his
sweatshirt. Then his T-shirt. He handed the Tshirt
to her. It was green and said ‘Prefab
Sprout.’
‘I can’t take this,’ she said, watching him pull
his sweatshirt back on over his bare chest. ‘It’s
new.’ Plus it probably wouldn’t fit.
‘You can give it back later.’
‘Close your eyes,’ she said.
‘Of course,’ Park said softly. He looked
away.
There was no one else in the parking lot.
Eleanor slouched down and put Park’s T-shirt on
underneath her own, then pulled the dirty shirt
off. That’s how she changed in gym class. His
shirt was about as tight as her gymsuit … but it
smelled clean, like Park.
‘Okay,’ she said.
556/593
He looked back at her, and his smile changed.
‘Keep it.’
When they got to Minneapolis, Park stopped at
another gas station to ask for directions.
‘Is it easy?’ she asked him when he got back
in the truck.
‘Like Sunday morning,’ he said. ‘We’re
really close.’
557/593
CHAPTER 54
Park
He was more nervous about his driving once they
got into the city. Driving in St Paul was nothing
like driving in Omaha.
Eleanor was reading the map for him, but
she’d never read a map outside of class before –
and between the two of them they kept making
wrong turns.
‘I’m sorry,’ Eleanor kept saying.
‘It’s okay,’ Park said, glad she was sitting
right next to him. ‘I’m not in any hurry.’
She pressed her hand into the top of his leg.
‘I’ve been thinking …’ she said.
‘Yeah?’
‘I don’t want you to come inside when we get
there.’
‘You mean you want to talk to them by
yourself?’
‘No … Well, yeah. But I mean … I don’t
want you to wait for me.’
He tried to look down at her, but he was
afraid he’d miss his turn again.
‘What?’ he said. ‘No. What if they don’t want
you to stay?’
‘Then they can figure out how to get me
home – I’ll be their problem. Maybe that’ll give
me more time to talk to them about everything.’
‘But …’ I’m not ready for you to stop being
my problem.
‘It makes more sense, Park. If you leave
soon, you can still get home by dark.’
‘But if I leave soon …’ His voice dropped. ‘I
leave soon.’
‘We have to say goodbye anyway,’ she said.
‘Does it matter if it’s now or a few hours from
now or tomorrow morning?’
‘Are you kidding?’ He looked down at her,
hoping he’d miss his turn. ‘Yes.’
559/593
Eleanor
‘It just makes more sense,’ she said. And then
she bit her lip. The only way she was going to get
through any of this was by force of will.
The houses were starting to look familiar –
big gray and white clapboard houses set far back
on their lawns. Eleanor’s whole family had come
up here for Easter the year after her dad left. Her
uncle and his wife were atheists, but it was still a
really fun trip.
They didn’t have kids of their own – probably
by choice, Eleanor thought. Probably because
they knew cute kids grow up into ugly, problematic
teenagers.
But Uncle Geoff had invited her here.
He wanted her to come, at least for a few
months. Maybe she didn’t have to tell him
everything right away, maybe he’d just think she
was early.
‘Is that it?’ Park asked.
He stopped in front of a gray-blue house with
a willow tree in the front yard.
560/593
‘Yeah,’ she said. She recognized the house.
She recognized her uncle’s Volvo in the
driveway.
Park stepped on the gas.
‘Where are you going?’
‘Just … around the block,’ he said.
Park
He drove around the block. For all the good it did
him. Then he parked a few houses down from her
uncle’s, so they could see the house from the car.
Eleanor couldn’t look away from it.
Eleanor
She had to say goodbye to him. Now. And she
didn’t know how.
Park
‘You remember my phone number right?’
561/593
‘867-5309.’
‘Seriously, Eleanor.’
‘Seriously, Park. I’m never going to forget
your phone number.’
‘Call me as soon as you can, okay? Tonight.
Collect. And give me your uncle’s number. Or, if
he doesn’t want you to call, send the number to
me in a letter – in one of the many, many letters
you’re going to write me.’
‘He might send me home.’
‘No.’ Park let go of the gearshift and took her
hand. ‘You’re not going back there. If your uncle
sends you home, come to my house. My parents
will help us figure it out. My dad already said
that they would.’
Eleanor’s head fell forward.
‘He’s not going to send you home,’ Park said.
‘He’s going to help …’ She nodded deliberately
at the floor. ‘And he’s going to let you accept frequent,
private, long-distance phone calls …’
She was still.
562/593
‘Hey,’ Park said, trying to lift up her chin.
‘Eleanor.’
Eleanor
Stupid Asian kid.
Stupid, beautiful Asian kid.
Thank God she couldn’t make her mouth
work right now, because if she could there’d be
no end to the melodramatic garbage she’d say to
him.
She was pretty sure she’d thank him for saving
her life. Not just yesterday, but, like, practically
every day since they’d met. Which made her
feel like the dumbest, weakest girl. If you can’t
save your own life, is it even worth saving?
There’s no such thing as handsome princes,
she told herself.
There’s no such thing as happily ever after.
She looked up at Park. Into his golden green
eyes.
563/593
You saved my life, she tried to tell him. Not
forever, not for good. Probably just temporarily.
But you saved my life, and now I’m yours. The
me that’s me right now is yours. Always.
Park
‘I don’t know how to say goodbye to you,’ she
said.
He smoothed her hair off her face. He’d never
seen her so fair. ‘Then don’t.’
‘But I have to go …’
‘So go,’ he said, with his hands on her
cheeks. ‘But don’t say goodbye. It’s not
goodbye.’
She rolled her eyes and shook her head.
‘That’s so lame.’
‘Seriously? You can’t cut me five minutes of
slack?’
‘That’s what people say – “It’s not goodbye”
– when they’re too afraid to face what they’re
really feeling. I’m not going to see you
564/593
tomorrow, Park – I don’t know when I’ll see you
again. That deserves more than “It’s not
goodbye.”’
‘I’m not afraid to face what I’m feeling,’ he
said.
‘Not you,’ she said, her voice breaking. ‘Me.’
‘You,’ he said, putting his arms around her
and promising himself that it wouldn’t be the last
time, ‘are the bravest person I know.’
She shook her head again, like she was trying
to shake off the tears.
‘Just kiss me goodbye,’ she whispered.
Only for today, he thought. Not ever.
Eleanor
You think that holding someone hard will bring
them closer. You think that you can hold them so
hard that you’ll still feel them, embossed on you,
when you pull away.
Every time Eleanor pulled away from Park,
she felt the gasping loss of him.
565/593
When she finally got out of the truck, it was
because she didn’t think she could stand touching
and untouching him again. The next time she
ripped herself away, she’d lose some skin.
Park started to get out with her, but she
stopped him.
‘No,’ she said. ‘Stay.’ She looked up
anxiously at her uncle’s house.
‘It’s going to be okay,’ Park said.
She nodded. ‘Right.’
‘Because I love you.’
She laughed. ‘Is that why?’
‘It is, actually.’
‘Goodbye,’ she said. ‘Goodbye, Park.’
‘Goodbye, Eleanor. You know, until tonight.
When you’re going to call me.’
‘What if they’re not home? God, that would
be anti-climactic.’
‘That would be great.’
‘Dork,’ she whispered with a leftover smile
on her face. She stepped back and closed the
door.
566/593
‘I love you,’ he mouthed. Maybe he was saying
it out loud. She couldn’t hear him anymore.
567/593
CHAPTER 55
Park
He didn’t ride the bus anymore. He didn’t have
to. His mom gave him the Impala when his dad
bought her a new Taurus …
He didn’t ride the bus anymore because he’d
have the whole seat to himself.
Not that the Impala wasn’t just as ruined with
memories. Some mornings, if Park got to school
early, he sat in the parking lot with his head on
the steering wheel and let whatever was left of
Eleanor wash over him until he ran out of air.
Not that school was any better.
She wasn’t at her locker. Or in class. Mr
Stessman said it was pointless to read Macbeth
out loud without Eleanor. ‘Fie, my Lord, fie,’ he
lamented.
She didn’t stay for dinner. She didn’t lean
against him when he watched TV.
Park spent most nights lying on his bed because
it was the only place she’d never been.
He lay on his bed and never turned on the
stereo.
Eleanor
She didn’t ride the bus anymore. She rode to
school with her uncle. He made her go, even
though there were only four weeks left, and
everybody was already studying for finals.
There weren’t any Asian kids at her new
school. There weren’t even any black kids.
When her uncle went down to Omaha, he
said she didn’t have to go. He was gone three
days, and when he came back, he brought the
black trash bag from her bedroom closet. Eleanor
already had new clothes. And a new bookcase
and a boombox. And a six-pack of blank cassette
tapes.
569/593
Park
Eleanor didn’t call that first night.
She hadn’t said that she would, now that he
thought about it. She hadn’t said that she’d write
either, but Park thought that went unsaid. He’d
thought that was a given.
After Eleanor got out of the truck, Park had
waited in front of her uncle’s house.
He was supposed to drive away as soon as the
door opened, as soon as it was clear that somebody
was home. But he couldn’t just leave her
like that.
He watched the woman who came to the door
give Eleanor a big hug, and then he watched the
door close behind them. And then he waited, just
in case Eleanor changed her mind. Just in case
she decided after all that he should come in.
The door stayed closed. Park remembered his
promise and drove away. The sooner I get home,
he thought, the sooner I’ll hear from her again.
570/593
He sent Eleanor a postcard from the first
truck stop. ‘Welcome to Minnesota, Land of
10,000 Lakes.’
When he got home, his mom ran to the door to
hug him.
‘All right?’ his dad asked.
‘Yeah,’ Park said.
‘How was the truck?’
‘Fine.’
His dad went outside to make sure.
‘You,’ his mom said, ‘I was so worried about
you.’
‘I’m fine, Mom, just tired.’
‘How’s Eleanor?’ she asked. ‘She okay?’
‘I think so, has she called?’
‘No. Nobody called.’
As soon as his mom would let go of him,
Park went to his room and wrote Eleanor a letter.
Eleanor
571/593
When Aunt Susan opened the door, Eleanor was
already crying.
‘Eleanor,’ Aunt Susan kept saying. ‘Oh my
goodness, Eleanor. What are you doing here?’
Eleanor tried to tell her that everything was
okay. Which wasn’t true – she wouldn’t be there
if everything was okay. But nobody was dead.
‘Nobody’s dead,’ she said.
‘Oh my God. Geoffrey!’ Aunt Susan called.
‘Wait here, sweetheart. Geoff …’
Left alone, Eleanor realized that she
shouldn’t have told Park to leave right away.
She wasn’t ready for him to leave.
She opened the front door and ran out to the
street. Park was already gone – she looked both
ways for him.
When she turned around, her aunt and uncle
were standing on the front porch watching her.
Phone calls. Peppermint tea. Her aunt and uncle
talking in the kitchen long after she went to bed.
‘Sabrina …’
‘Five of them.’
572/593
‘We’ve got to get them out of there, Geoffrey
…’
‘What if she isn’t telling the truth?’
Eleanor took Park’s photo out of her back
pocket and smoothed it out on the bedspread. It
didn’t look like him. October was already a lifetime
away. And this afternoon was another lifetime.
The world was spinning so fast, she didn’t
know where she stood anymore.
Her aunt had lent her some pajamas – they
wore about the same size – but Eleanor put
Park’s shirt back on as soon as she got out of the
shower.
It smelled like him. Like his house, like potpourri.
Like soap, like boy, like happiness.
She fell forward onto the bed, holding the
hole in her stomach.
No one would ever believe her.
She wrote her mom a letter.
She said everything she’d wanted to say in
the last six months.
She said she was sorry.
573/593
She begged her to think of Ben and Mouse –
and Maisie.
She threatened to call the police.
Her Aunt Susan gave her a stamp. ‘They’re in
the junk drawer, Eleanor, take as many as you
need.’
Park
When he got sick of his bedroom, when there
was nothing left in his life that smelled like
vanilla – Park walked by Eleanor’s house.
Sometimes the truck was there, sometimes it
wasn’t, sometimes the Rottweiler was asleep on
the porch. But the broken toys were gone, and
there were never any strawberry-blond kids playing
in the yard.
Josh said that Eleanor’s little brother had
stopped coming to school. ‘Everybody says
they’re gone. The whole family.’
574/593
‘That great news,’ their mother said. ‘Maybe
that pretty mom wake up to bad situation, you
know? Good for Eleanor.’
Park just nodded.
He wondered if his letters even got to
wherever she was now.
Eleanor
There was a red rotary phone in the spare bedroom.
Her bedroom. Whenever it rang, Eleanor
felt like picking it up and saying, ‘What is it,
Commissioner Gordon?’
Sometimes, when she was alone in the house,
she took the phone over to her bed and listened to
the dial tone.
She practiced Park’s number, her finger sliding
across the dial. Sometimes, after the dial tone
stopped, she pretended he was whispering in her
ear.
‘Have you ever had a boyfriend?’ Dani asked.
Dani was in theater camp, too. They ate lunch
575/593
together, sitting on the stage with their legs
dangling in the orchestra pit.
‘No,’ Eleanor said.
Park wasn’t a boyfriend, he was a champion.
And they weren’t going to break up. Or get
bored. Or drift apart. (They weren’t going to become
another stupid high school romance.)
They were just going to stop.
Eleanor had decided back in his dad’s truck.
She’d decided in Albert Lea, Minnesota. If they
weren’t going to get married – if it wasn’t forever
– it was only a matter of time.
They were just going to stop.
Park was never going to love her more than
he did on the day they said goodbye.
And she couldn’t bear to think of him loving
her less.
Park
When he got sick of himself, Park went to her old
house. Sometimes the truck was there.
576/593
Sometimes it wasn’t. Sometimes, Park stood at
the end of the sidewalk and hated everything the
house stood for.
577/593
CHAPTER 56
Eleanor
Letters, postcards, packages that rattled like
loaded cassette tapes. None of them opened, none
of them read.
‘Dear Park,’ she wrote on a clean sheet of stationery.
‘Dear Park,’ she tried to explain.
But the explanations fell apart in her hands.
Everything true was too hard to write – he was
too much to lose. Everything she felt for him was
too hot to touch.
‘I’m sorry,’ she wrote, then crossed it out.
‘It’s just …’ she tried again.
She threw the half-written letters away. She
threw the unopened envelopes in the bottom
drawer.
‘Dear Park,’ she whispered, her forehead
hanging over the dresser, ‘just stop.’
Park
His dad said Park needed a summer job to pay for
gas.
Neither of them mentioned that Park never
went anywhere. Or that he’d started putting eyeliner
on with his thumb. Blacking out his own
eyes.
He looked just wrecked enough to get a job at
Drastic Plastic. The girl who hired him had two
rows of holes in each ear.
His mom stopped bringing in the mail. He
knew it was because she hated telling him that
nothing had come for him. Park brought in the
mail himself now every night when he got home
from work. Every night praying for rain.
He had an endless supply and an insatiable
appetite for punk music. ‘I can’t hear myself
think in here,’ his dad said, coming into Park’s
579/593
room for the third night in a row to turn down the
stereo.
Duh, Eleanor would have said.
Eleanor didn’t start school in the fall. Not with
Park anyway.
She didn’t celebrate the fact that juniors don’t
have to take gym. She didn’t say, ‘Unholy union,
Batman,’ when Steve and Tina eloped over Labor
Day.
Park had written her a letter all about it. He’d
told her everything that happened, and everything
that didn’t, every day since she’d left.
He kept writing her letters months after he
stopped sending them. On New Year’s Day, he
wrote that he hoped she’d get everything she ever
wished for. Then he tossed the letter into a box
under his bed.
580/593
CHAPTER 57
Park
He’d stopped trying to bring her back.
She only came back when she felt like it anyway,
in dreams and lies and broken-down déjà
vu.
Like, Park would be driving to work and he’d
see a girl with red hair standing on the street, and
he’d swear for half an airless moment that it was
her.
Or he’d wake up when it was still dark, sure
that she was waiting for him outside. Sure that
she needed him.
But he couldn’t summon her. Sometimes he
couldn’t even remember what she looked like,
even when he was looking at her picture. (Maybe
he’d looked at it too much.)
He’d stopped trying to bring her back.
So why did he keep coming here? To this
crappy little house …
Eleanor wasn’t here, she was never really
here – and she’d been gone too long. Almost a
year now.
Park turned to walk away from the house, but
the little brown truck whipped too fast into the
driveway, jumping the curb and nearly clipping
him. Park stopped on the sidewalk and waited.
The driver’s side door swung open.
Maybe, he thought. Maybe this is why I’m
here.
Eleanor’s stepdad – Richie – leaned slowly
out of the cab. Park recognized him from the one
time he’d seen him before, when Park had
brought Eleanor the second issue of Watchmen,
and her stepdad had answered the door …
The final issue of Watchmen came out a few
months after Eleanor left. He wondered if she’d
read it, and whether she thought Ozymandias was
a villain, and what she thought Dr Manhattan
582/593
meant when he said, ‘Nothing ever ends’ at the
end. Park still wondered what Eleanor thought
about everything.
Her stepdad didn’t see Park at first. Richie
was moving slowly, uncertainly. When he did
notice Park, he looked at him like he wasn’t sure
he was really there. ‘Who are you?’ Richie
shouted.
Park didn’t answer. Richie turned jaggedly,
jerking toward him. ‘What do you want?’ Even
from a few feet away, he smelled sour. Like beer,
like basements.
Park stood his ground.
I want to kill you, he thought. And I can, he
realized. I should.
Richie wasn’t much bigger than Park, and he
was drunk and disoriented. Plus, he could never
want to hurt Park as much as Park wanted to hurt
him.
Unless Richie was armed, unless he got lucky
– Park could do this.
583/593
Richie shuffled closer. ‘What do you want?’
he shouted again. The force of his own voice
knocked him off balance and he tipped forward,
falling thickly to the ground. Park had to step
back not to catch him.
‘Fuck,’ Richie said, raising himself up on his
knees and holding himself not quite steady.
I want to kill you, Park thought.
And I can.
Someone should.
Park looked down at his steel-toe Docs. He’d
just bought them at work. (On sale, with his employee
discount.) He looked at Richie’s head,
hanging from his neck like a leather bag.
Park hated him more than he thought it was
possible to hate someone. More than he’d ever
thought it was possible to feel anything …
Almost.
He lifted his boot and kicked the ground in
front of Richie’s face. Ice and mud and driveway
slopped into the older man’s open mouth. Richie
coughed violently and banked into the ground.
584/593
Park waited for him to get up, but Richie just
lay there spitting curses, and rubbing salt and
gravel into his eyes.
He wasn’t dead. But he wasn’t getting up.
Park waited.
And then he walked home.
Eleanor
Letters, postcards, yellow padded packages that
rattled in her hands. None of them opened, none
of them read.
It was bad when the letters came every day. It
was worse when they stopped.
Sometimes she laid them out on the carpet
like tarot cards, like Wonka bars, and wondered
whether it was too late.
585/593
CHAPTER 58
Park
Eleanor didn’t go to prom with him.
Cat did.
Cat from work. She was thin and dark, and
her eyes were as blue and flat as breath mints.
When Park held Cat’s hand, it was like holding
hands with a mannequin, and it was such a relief
that he kissed her. He fell asleep on prom night in
his tuxedo pants and a Fugazi T-shirt.
He woke up the next morning when
something light fell on his shirt – he opened his
eyes. His dad was standing over him.
‘Mail call,’ his dad said, almost gently. Park
put his hand to his heart.
Eleanor hadn’t written him a letter.
It was a postcard. ‘Greetings from the Land
of 10,000 Lakes,’ it said on the front. Park turned
it over and recognized her scratchy handwriting.
It filled his head with song lyrics.
He sat up. He smiled. Something heavy and
winged took off from his chest.
Eleanor hadn’t written him a letter, it was a
postcard.
Just three words long.
